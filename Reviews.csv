daisukereds, Sort of disappointed..,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.",16 September 2021
educallejero, Questionable script (and Awkwafina is just the worst),"The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded ""deux-ex machina"" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"", ""WW84"" and ""The Expendables"" writers).Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen and a same type of joke (""awkward nonsense"") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the ""Shang-Chi world"" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers.",14 September 2021
BA_Harrison," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Superhero.","Martial arts meets the MCU in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. More Crouching Tiger than Jackie Chan, the plot for the film is kinda hum-drum, the sort of mystical Eastern fantasy cobblers that practically writes itself.Shang-Chi is the son of immortal, power-hungry warlord Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and Li (Fala Chen), a warrior woman from the hidden village of Ta Lo. After falling in love with Li and becoming a father, Wenwu gives up his wicked ways and packs away the ten legendary rings that gave him much of his power. However, after his wife is killed by his old enemies, Wenwu once again wears the rings and trains his son to become an assassin. Ashamed of what he has become, Shang-Chi goes into hiding in America and becomes Shaun (Simu Liu), but his past eventually catches up with him when his father sends his army, The Ten Rings, to steal the pendants given to him and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) by their mother. Wenwu requires both pendants to reveal the way to Ta Lo, where he believes that his wife is being held captive by her people.This Marvel movie is at its most fun before the plot starts to get in the way and the CGI becomes too overbearing and intrusive: the early fight scenes - a battle on a runaway bus against a henchman known as Razor Fist, and a fight on some high-rise bamboo scaffolding - deliver lots of impressively choreographed action that will please both martial arts fans and superhero addicts. Awkwafina, as Shang-Chi's loyal friend Katy, provides some comic relief, but also gets stuck in with the action.Unfortunately, the film quickly goes downhill after the good guys make their way to Ta Lo, with a little help from Tony Slattery (see Iron Man 3) and a furry winged creature with no face. The inevitable battle between the villagers and Wenwu's army is typical overblown Marvel mayhem, but the massive CGI tsunami arrives when Wenwu opens the inter-dimensional gate that he thinks is holding Li prisoner: instead of releasing his wife, he frees a swarm of flying tentacled soul-suckers and their big bad boss The Dweller. Fortunately for the Ta Lo people, they have a massive magical dragon on their side, which wakes up and adds to the digital whizz-bangery.As technically impressive as the special effects are, I found the second half of the film visually overwhelming yet remarkably uninvolving - a whirlwind of pixels and noisy action without much substance.5/10. It was nice to see HK/Chinese stars Michelle Yeoh, Tony Leung and Yuen Wah together in a Marvel movie; I just wish it had been a better one.",27 February 2022
topdog-64841, Surprisingly good,"I'll be honest - Marvel movies are not in my top 20 or even 50 but within the Marvel ""Universe"" I would say that Shang-Chi is in my top 5. I know, it's blasphemy and all that but think about it - is it better than Iron Man? I would admit yes - it's origin story is arguably better, and it's characters are a lot deeper. The Mandarin is a conflicted man, with evil but good as well, like real life. Is this movie better than The Avengers or Ragnarok or Infinity Wars? Hard to say, which means it's right up there with the best (of Marvel) in my opinion.Plus, I'm a sucker for Chinese movies with the Chinese language being spoken - 1 of my favourite of all times, if not my absolute favourite, is of course 'Hero.' The Chinese language and the artistry of it's culture are magnificent.All in all, well done Marvel, director Destin, and all those who worked to make this movie a reality. This is not just your average summer action movie; it's close to being a Masterpiece. And the humour is pretty swell too!Cheers.",28 November 2021
brookenichole-98054, Could've been great,"Shang-Chi is a boring film. The characters were okay, but the story was choppy and confusing. The song choices were odd. Plus, this movie was way too long. And the scene at the end had me practically falling asleep.",14 November 2021
Top_Dawg_Critic, This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.",11 November 2021
justwen89," beautiful science fiction, fantasy and action movie!","Everything comes in it beautiful science fiction and beautiful mythical creatures. Sometimes you have creatures that don't seem real, but these just seemed real. Well done! There was a bit of avatar feeling in it. Fighting for the safekeeping of peace. Really beautiful. And self-acceptance was also nicely incorporated.",17 November 2021
Everymoviegetsa10, Shang Empty,"Sorry for the delay.Here we go...I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealousI'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plotTHOR Loki daddy issue

MackMonMay87, A Ringer for a Great MCU Flick,"Shang-Chi is one of Marvel Comic's most unknown and underutilized characters in their comics, with his original comics containing a decent amount of racist imagery and embarrassing caricatures of various Asian stereotypes. At it's best, the MCU can turn any obscure group or concept from the comics into gold, and Shang-Chi is no different.Shang-Chi might be one of the best examples of an idea that's actually better on film than the original source material, with the character's relationships, motivations, and place in the overall Marvel Universe all being improved upon in the film adaptation as opposed to the comics where he's mainly a hand-to-hand expert with no powers or special weapons, and isn't generally of much value to The Avengers.Simu Liu is charismatic and athletically gifted enough to do solid justice to the lead role. I hope the sequel gives him even more to do with his character and his legacy, but for an introduction, this was great. Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and of course the legendary Tony Leung all lend their talents to a great cast of characters.Wen Wu is easily one of the top villain/antagonist characters in the MCU and probably all of comic book films. He's intimidating and masterful as a ruler, but heartfelt and believable as a family man. His presence elevates the entire production as he's a legend of cinema.There's moments reminiscent of Black Panther, and the third act gets heavy into Chinese mythological imagery, but understand that this is not only meant as a superhero movie, but also a love-letter to Chinese storytelling and culture.Shang-Chi features some of the best physical/non-super powered fight scenes in the MCU, with the choreography and the cinematography of said action taking a higher level. As soon as I saw the bus fight scene in the opening I had no worries about this part of the movie.The Ten Rings themselves are not a weapon used in the comics, and are a wonderfully creative, versatile, and visually stunning weapon unlike anything I've ever seen before, and that's not an easy thing to say having seen as much comic book and sci-fi material as me.Some of the pacing and character development could be a little better, but overall Shang-Chi is on the higher end of Marvel movies, and can also be solidly enjoyed by audiences totally unfamiliar with Marvel in general.",26 November 2021
sanjithkumar1995, Good action movie with all the MCU flavours,"Movie has a lot of stuff to keep you hooked.1. VFX. Whole movie is visually stunning
2. Stunt choreography is awesome. Probably the best in MCU so far imo.3. Background score. I felt goosebumps everytime the main theme kicks in. Soundtrack is good too.4. Decent acting except the one who played Shang chi's father who had a menacing screen presenceDespite of the perfectly blended Chinese culture and the MCU's successful (so far) action formula, this movie isn't free from cliche moments. I just wished the second half was less predictable and had something more to offer.",22 November 2021
AyonSahaa, LIVELY!,"Watched the IMAX version! Best solo since Iron Man (2008)! I had no expectations of this before. But the movie is much more lively. Enjoyed every moment. And also very engaging from start to finish. A kinda Cute-Action movie with some fun stuff!This is the first movie that focuses more on martial arts than Marvel's superpower thing. Love to see a mix of Marvel's MASTER-LEVEL-CGI with Martial art. Kung-Fu with this kind of visual effect! Marvel nailed it again.I've always loved Marvel's casting. Katy is too perfect for her role. Loved her chemistry with Shaun. Also laughed out loud at her childish stuffs.Just one thing, not a big deal, the action scene of 'Dragon Riding' doesn't fit into the usual Marvel movie. But as Chinese flavor, it is OK. Except for this, the cinematography and VFX are a lot mesmerizing!",27 November 2021

dasa108, Mediocre film from Marvel,"Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view. It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland.",21 September 2021
jasminn_tan, It was okay...,"I really liked that the actors spoke their native language, Mandarin, because it would've felt too Americanized otherwise. But there was something unfinished about this movie and I'm not sure what it is. The pacing was alright, a little too slow or fast at times, and as far as storylines go, it was not as exciting as I thought it would be. The fight scenes were great though, especially the final grand battle scene.",21 November 2021
raiyans-98227," Fresh Story, Great action scenes","I love all the movies from them but Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is one of my favorite marvel movies, it really managed to make a very nice movie, the story is usually a gorgeous one, the characters are very nice and you become very invested in the movie.I was amazed at what good fight sequences are in the movie like this, the best since The Avengers 2012 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier 2014 maybe even better.The CGI is incredible, I only saw such special effects on Avatar.I have to say that I ran and saw the fight on the bus 5 times, it's awesome ... it manages to give you an energy boost, so cool
The story is extraordinary, Shang-Chi confronts the past he thought he left behind, when his father wants to reunite his lost family.Xu Wenwu played by Tony Leung is such a good villain, you understand why he does this, you empathize with him and although you know that the way he acts is wrong you understand his pain. Besides being a villain he is also my father and everything he wants to release his wife.A very good villain, certainly one of the best villains of this year.This movie blow me away, I love it. Lots of love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩",2 December 2021
tonyk6289, Great movie,I thought it was a great hero movie. It developed the character as well as others and felt like the story was complete. This story was over and now it's time for the next.,26 November 2021
Sir_AmirSyarif, Marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Destin Daniel Cretton's 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc. Simu Liu has a strong presence as Shang-Chi, yet he is overshadowed by many of his more experienced co-stars.",24 October 2021
gtenalokes, Dumb and Stupid....,"It had potential but marvel has this tendency of degrading everything into mindless comedy...Things just happen, to an extent where Awkwafina is now an avenger...
I'm getting too old for this s#.t..",11 November 2021
0w0," It's very pretty, but the story/plot is mediocre and filled with holes","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan.",25 December 2021
cc0077, Another great Marvel Movie,"I loved the cast, music, plot, everything. I especially loved Xialing because she was so powerful. Morris was also so so adorable. I really enjoyed all the action, as well as some comedic scenes and I'm so ready for the next Shang-Chi movie!",26 November 2021
mkayseryan, HORRIBLE,"This was so bad , I'm honestly shocked on how lazy the writing is I really am. This was probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time wow. No hate on the actors or even some fight scenes but this was sooooooooo bad.",13 November 2021
planktonrules, A visual feast.,"I am not a big fan of the many, many Marvel films. The only reason I saw this one was that my oldest daughter insisted I watch it....and overall I was impressed by the movie, though I think it was enjoyable more for the insane eye candy than the story itself.I could talk about the plot but just noticed that there are over 2000 reviews for this film. So, I'll just say that it looked great and would have been great to have seen it on the big screen. The story itself, though enjoyable, wasn't one that particularly grabbed me or impacted on me...possibly because it was so violent and frenetic that the film, as a consequence, lacked intimacy and humanity.",1 December 2021
jigsawjoey, This like anime but love action which is great,This film is a love letter to Asia. The creatures the atmosphere the fights. They really took their time with this. Many people complain about final fight but if you watch anime or know of anime you should know better.,21 November 2021
catalinmarian-13885, So good!!,"The best marvel movie after Endgame. The story is a bit cliché but the rest is absolutely amazing. The fight scenes are the best in the MCU in my opinion. Simu Liu as Shang-Chi is perfectly chosen and all the other characters are nice and the all the actors do a good job. Act 3 is on another level that we haven't seen before in MCU and the visual effects are spectacular, by far one of the best origin stories from Marvel!",5 December 2021
ronin-88, Better than expected!,"The buzz was high on this film but I kept my expectations modest. It started off as a charming story, well told and authentic. The action, and the acting were fine. Then the action dipped a little in the middle. But, once Shang Chi and his gang escaped the stronghold of the 10 rings, the movie really took off. It was a magnificent freaking story. The legend, the fighting, the story, and the tremendous acting were all there. This is as good an MCU movie as there ever was. I was totally blown away by it. It was a great idea to have top actors in the movie and let them do their thing. The leads Simu Liu and Akwafina are solid but the burden of carrying the movie isn't entirely placed on their shoulders. Their parents and auntie (Tony Leung, Fala Chen, and Michelle Yeoh) have to do some of the dramatic heavy lifting.",3 December 2021
jamesrupert2014, More of the same from the hyperactive Marvell/Disney CGI-verse,"Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects). Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.",14 February 2022
darth_trek, Simu Liu Brought It,"Really entertaining movie. Actors were great Simu Liu brought it big time he is excellent as the main character. Awkwafina is hilarious and I wish she had more screen time. As far as Marvel movies goes, it's not the best one but still very good.",23 November 2021

zadeereviews," Soulless movie, even a soul sucking monster couldn't give this a soul",This is the worst marvel movie I have seen to date.after seeing the movie I was honestly surprised by all the high ratings. Did we watch the same thing? The movie is without a soul. Characters aren't build up enough even with a 2 hour run time. The movie literally got nothing to do with the ten rings. Movie became Godzilla vs King Kong at the end. Waste of 2 hours. Honestly clueless why people high praised for this movie. What a waste of opportunity to create a wonderful and authentic world for Asian marvel universe.,13 November 2021

Marvel has been showing its MARVELous magic since Ironman, and Shang-Chi is another diamond in the crown. After the end of MCU's phase 3, fans were eagerly waiting for a big movie. Black Widow was not up to the mark and Eternals also disappointed majority of fans, but Chang-Chi filled their gap. The action scenes were fresh and engaging.

view_and_review, Ten Years too Late,"I've said this before about Marvel movies: they are a victim of their own success. ""Shang-Chi"" had to follow up a decade and a half of quality MCU movies, so the same movie that would've been a smash 10 years ago isn't viewed quite the same today. The movie was good, but it failed to really separate itself.""The Legend of Ten Rings"" as a title already sounds too much like LOTR. And in fact it was something like it in that he with the rings had the power. Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) had the ten rings which gave him near omnipotence. With the ten rings he could defeat entire armies and live forever. He decided to use the rings to become a tyrant.He was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life, a woman he found after living 1000 years. I thought it was a bit strange that it took the man 1000 years to find his true love, but I didn't dwell on it.Stranger than him taking a thousand years to find his true love was the woman who fell in love with him. She lived in a secret magical village in Macao that was totally isolated from the rest of the world. She was a gentle benign character who had powers herself and was able to defeat Wenwu when he came to essentially conquer her village. Somehow, through their Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-esque battle they fell in love. Maybe that makes sense for him being that he finally found someone who could defeat him, but it didn't make sense for this nearly pure woman to fall for a man with a 1000 year history of tyranny.Still, they wed, forsook their powers and started a family.Their family would be unceremoniously destroyed when an old foe of Wenwu--a vicious gang--came by their house to get their pound of flesh and killed Wenwu's wife, Li (Fala Chen). Li could've attempted to barter with them for some sort of material exchange for their past losses, but instead she immediately decided she'd try to fight the entire gang and lost her life in the process. That would cause Wenwu to don the ten rings again and return to tyranny.So, if you're keeping score on Wenwu's wife, 1.) she was smitten with a man who came to destroy her village and 2.) she chose to fight an entire gang with no powers to speak of and with no attempts to negotiate.I recognize that it was a plot device to advance the plot, but it could've been done a lot better and with more tact. Her character never struck me as someone impulsive and/or not able to judge character yet she exhibited both flaws.Most of what I've covered was garnered throughout the movie via flashbacks. The real main character was Saun aka Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). He was the son of Wenwu and Li. Years later we see an adult Saun. He lives in SF and is a valet. He is violently thrust back into the life he ran away from when his father's goons came for the pendant around his neck given to him by his mother. It was at this point we learned his backstory, of which I've given some already. We find out he also has a sister, Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), who Disney not so subtly informed us she had to train herself to become a fierce warrior because of her gender. The two of them had been split up for close to twenty years when Saun ran away after being trained to be an assassin by his father. He was fourteen at the time and she was ten when he promised her he'd be back. He never came back and when they met again in Macao as adults she held the same ten-year-old bitterness against him for running away as though a fourteen-year-old should've been more reliable. She greeted him with a butt-kicking that was twenty years in the making. It's clear that it never crossed her mind that he may have been killed, or maybe she would've considered his death a betrayal as well. Either way it was a completely childish way to handle reuniting with your long lost brother.The two of them would join forces along with Saun's friend Katy (Awkwafina) and really quickly to stop their father. He was going to use the ten rings to breach a portal to another dimension which contained some soul-sucking demons.The introduction of demons to the movie did offer some excitement. It upped the stakes of everyone involved and thrust another Marvel character into the role of saving the world.Saun would save the world with the help of his friends and family. Some would die, but the most important characters lived. I was somewhat satisfied with the movie. The acting was commendable and Awkwafina was good as the comic relief. ""Shang-Chi"" may just be the placement of a singular brick to build to something bigger, I just hope what Marvel is building towards is worth it.",14 September 2021
Cheesecake3001, Entertaining action movie with great special effects.,"This movie is to me a pleasant surprise. The father-son storyline was touching. The special effects are excellent.

Zi_Reviews_Movies, It has a ring to it...,"Everybody around me raved about this movie, but I watched it very late and now I'm slightly disappointed. It didn't live up to all the hype and all the praise but seemed very much like any other Marvel movie. But what I am truly impressed with, was the blend of martial arts in the MCU, it fit so perfectly. This wasn't just another movie with a sprinkle of Asian characters for representation, no this actually tells their story, speaks their language, and depicts the details. The fight scenes are fun, there is some light comedy, no gore, and the CGI was gooooood. The backstory and narration made the fantasy seem real.It pulled at my heartstrings when it connected to Iron Man, I did not see that coming though it certainly made up for my disappointment with Awkwafina (Katy). The movie had a lot of slow parts and parts where I was losing interest and seemed somewhat like a good vs evil movie? Come to think of it, it felt like a Disney movie trying to teach me about Asian cultures and the inherent good in the universe.I'll agree it was dramatic and stays with you as 20 minutes post the movie, I was trying to channel the universe with open palms and gentle hand motions. Not something I do every day.",21 November 2021
kingx-90803, This Movie was Amazing. Dont get why so much hate,"I thought this movie would suck honestly when i heard it was being made, i thought shang chi is a terrible character with no powers and then i always dread hollywood making asian movies lol.Im chinese by the way and when i finally watched it i was blown away!!! This was best movie of the year, maybe one of the best marvel movies that didnt involve a blockbuster teamup like avengers infinity wars and end game.So action packed, excellent script, insane graphic visuals, insane fighting choreography, alot of character depth and explorations. Well made indeed! This is the Black panther movie for all asians! I say all asians because chinese culture has affected all asian countries in the last 3000 years.Dont let the reviews bother you, alot of these people dont know what their talking about honestly. Seen 1 person mention theirs no villain But this movie takes villain into an indepth look. For every villain theirs a drive & purpose to why they do things and for this villain it involved love. Some may not be able to comprehend this as they view villains stone cold killers maybe or just destructive no emotion type of baddies.They wrote the script for this villain amazingly considering he was originally the Mandarin (a very stereotypical villain hated by asians). The clever way they were able to remove that racist heritage to this character was flawless, funny and amazing.I mean cmon it was hilarious the way the villain described how his name came.Some even complained they got lost during the whole movie which i found it hard to believe. I mean you must have Low IQ lmao go not understand n follow through the movie. From beginning to end it was a step through step process. Maybe they could have explored more about the magical lands but whois to say they wont in future movies?? All u needed to know was in the movie, and any other questions can be saved for the future just as most marvel movies always do.The fight scenes on the Bus were off the charts and so was the rest of it. I can see theirs many chinese people hating on this film cuz they feel the fighting style is too like Chinese movies fighting style But they dont get it. What made this movie very good was the amazing way they blended chinese and western movies together. The fight scenes was neither just chinese nor was it western, it was a perfect blend.This stories villajn was writting the way Thanos was but better. Thanos was not just crazy mad villain, he had purpose and feelings and goals that involved not just world domination or killing. Same with this villain, Tony Leung may have had not many lines in this movie but the way he carried his presence and the acting was outstanding.I have watched tony leung in hong kong movies for 30 years now and his acting is impeccable. He brought life to the Villain he played, and gave it a more down to earth and also relatable character portrayal. Anyone in his position in the movie would have had a chance to go his path, i know many might disagree but it was so easy to see how he deviated from the good path he took for some time back to evil. You just need to understand the character and his reasons and experiences.The main character Sima Liu i mean was pretty good choice, their were some scenes for fighting that looked to be him doing the stunts and it was amazing.I seen some complain that the movie should have been just mandarin but thats clearly a comment made by someone from China or mandarin speaking. To them they live in the old age where black is black, white is white, theirs no grey.Only way asians can move forward in hollywood is by a blend of both west n east.Maybe some people might hate it cause its so much asian characters n that its got mandarin language in it, then u got others who hate it cuz theirs english in it. Both groups need to grow up and live in the year 2021 cuz this movie was so successful because of the mixture of both cultures in 1.If this movie was just another straight chinese martial arts flick it would certainly not be successful in the west. This blend is what makes it open up to other races to watch and enjoy.The special effects of the movie was off the charts! Amazing!! The fighting too!This movie is the Black panther for asians. Its the opening door for asians to be introduced more commonly.If anyone in or from China reads this i think u should think hard to yourself, Do you want to see more chinese movies succeed in the future?? Cuz if so then u should ccheer this movie on cause its gonna open doors for chinese actors n actresses.China blocking this movie from playing makes no sense as the way for China to spread love is share their culture with all especially after the pandemic fiasco. This movie opens the doors of chinese culture up to westerners.So support this movie! And stop bashing it for unfounded selfish reasons.",2 December 2021
boblipton, Next Phase,"It was an okay movie. Simu Liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the Ten Rings --always good to see Tony Leung, and I hope he soaked Disney --who winds up opposing his dad, and Awkwafina is his slacker sort-of girlfriend. They are fine in the leads, as is Meng'er Zhang as his sister, and Michelle Yeoh as their aunt -- always good to see her, and I hope she soaked Disney too.I have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades, and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why. They don't make movies like that any more, and when they try, they're often embarrassing. People don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song, or expressing their emotions through dance. No, they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head. To me, the fight choreography is its own dance, and the fight between Leung and Fala Chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between Astaire and Rogers.There are problems aplenty with this film. There's an immense amount of exposition, starting off with twenty minutes of it in Chinese. I'm not sure why Ben Kingsley as the fake 'Mandarin' from IRON MAN 3 is present except for a certain remnant of star power and connecting this to the rest of the MCU. Still, with my expectations not set particularly high, I had a good time.",11 September 2021
chunkylefunga, A miss in the MCU.,"Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.Always hate it when they make a villain not really a villain as to not offend anyone. Shang Chi's father is supposed to be a pure villain, the mother storyline took away a lot from the real storyline.Awkwafina's character becoming a boss archer after one day of training was equally ridiculous.Hopefully if a sequel is made it will be darker, though I'll admit the Mandarin was a funny touch.",14 November 2021
clarkmick33, A weird mix of Marvel and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"As far as Marvel being a fantasy film they generally like to be grounded in reality of history of the world and the current setting... but this one is really really going into the fantasy setting of parallel universes of Chinese myth. So for me it kinda felt totally fantastical and not really connected to any of the other Marvel universe.The fight and chorography of the action scenes is impressive and entertaining and if a movie could be watched on that basis alone then this would do the job - unfortunately for Shang Chi you actually need a compelling story with interesting characters.... but what we got was the MASSIVELY overdone .. evil father and son who seeks redemption arc... other supporting characters were pretty much all one dimensional - either good or bad, black or white.I also felt that Samuel Liu was miscast in the main role... If Donnie Yen was younger he probably would have done a better job. Samuel just does not have the screen presence.Its entertaining for the kids but I think the adults will be bored.",13 November 2021
SaturnCoyote, Actually Really Enjoyed It!,"Whoa! I watched Shang-Chi because I wanted to put something on in the background and I just ended up getting invested!I would go to say this is one of the best singular films in the MCU. I found films such as Thor and Black Panther slightly boring. They are full of information but I just couldn't get invested as much as I wanted too. I'd slightly fallen out of my obsession with the MCU over the past couple of years, but Shang-Chi could help bring my obsession back.It's about so many things at once, but the main plot is basically about Shang-Chi trying to find family with his friend Katie. That's the best way to describe it without minor spoilers. I believe this film really represented the culture well, and the scenery really helped to intrigue me to keep watching longer. The characters are all pretty likeable too and the fight scenes were amazing!A criticism I would have, which I have with many Marvel films, is that I feel like some scenes dragged on a little too long, but that's me really picking in details. I also found it hard to follow the plot at one point, but I soon picked back up what was happening.I really recommend this, even if you're not a fan of the MCU. I'd say it's one of Marvels strongest movies that has released recently! Really looking forward to where Marvel takes this series next.",24 November 2021

staunton-gary, Entertained,"Simple as that, it's worth watching. Luckily I had Subtitles on for the Chinese speaking parts, and that helped, especially at the start of the movie (about 10 minutes). Don't forget the end credit scene at 2:01:46.",2 December 2021

Two goodens in a row what with Snake Eyes!The fight scenes we well worked through and the opening bus sequence was very memorable. I don't thing there was anything I didn't like about this movie so I'm giving 10 outta 1.",24 November 2021
joao-luiz_mjr," Good choreography, disappointing story","The martial arts is refreshingly well-filmed and clearly homages/references classic Wuxia Chinese movies, complete with wire-fu and fancy kung-fu posing, which I love, so kudos for that. There was also an admirable amount of effort dedicated to creating beautiful set-pieces ranging from mystical bamboo forests toMy problem, though, comes from not being able to really keep my disbelief suspended throughout the movie because of just how lazy the storytelling is. Clunky, 10th grade expository dialogue, contrivances to force the characters where they're supposed to be, and all the standard Disney trademark cleanliness - Oh, the bad guys are literal assassins about to slaughter these villagers? Let's have them fight with the wimpiest, most non-lethal tasers ever, because God forbid there's any meaningful violence against anything other than the CG monsters...",22 November 2021
dochands, So ends the Marvel Universe,To see Sir Ben Kingsley reprise his role as comedy relief for a movie that already has us suffering through another Awkafina performance is sad and redundant. This is what happens when Disney and Marvel try too hard to find a path forward after Endgame. The Asian theme is new but the vague attempts to tie the movie to the MCU smack of desperation. This is just not a good movie. A lot of expensive visuals but that does not make a movie good. Lots of narrative and exposition to explain the visuals but that does not make the movie good or interesting. I understand that it is show business and this movie was made to make money but if I hadn't been lucky enough to watch it on Disney+ I would feel cheated.,12 November 2021
westsideschl, Dumbing Down Cheap,"Lots of copied ideas from other films, and poorly executed. Very tossed together & cheaply not realistic.The usual opening scene of vast armies on plains with the usual barrage of arrows. The Army of the Ten Rings is led by the usual immortal who, as usual, steals ten arm bracelets which as usual are suppose to be hidden because of their power to, as usual bring immortality & create immense destructive force. The seen before Disney style fantasy creatures (same old lion, horse, dragons, odd little creatures). The usual electrical, laser, and pressure force as our weapons. Redundant, boring, cheap to digitally reproduce. Possessor supposedly over a thousand + years develops an army that for centuries (up until now) has spread to every corner of the world (odd, I never heard of them).",15 January 2022

nicksmoviereviews, Marvel's Inner Chi,"Shang-Chi is arguably the most original and entertaining origin story that Marvel's delivered in quite some time. Coming from someone who's slowly starting to get superhero fatigue from both sides of the aisle, this one delivers. It's a spectacle, and has a family drama that feel's Shakespearean at times. In many ways this is how I wanted the live-action version of Mulan to be.",5 December 2021

crom-dubh, Better than I expected!,"This was just a lot of fun. The story wasn't as tight as it could have been, but I found myself enjoying the whole movie regardless. The fight choreography was bangin', and all the action was just very well directed. Everything felt purposeful and exhilarating. The beginning of the movie feels like a straight-up martial arts movie and then as it progresses we get more and more fantasy elements working their way in which felt like a nice contrast. The music definitely felt like it added a lot here. I kept being reminded of how mixing different elements in with the more traditional orchestrated sounds really worked for Black Panther's soundtrack, and I honestly think this film did it even better. I think that, all in all, this is probably the best thing Marvel has produced since Endgame.",6 December 2021
iggyzero, More of this Disney!,"Cretton is an amazing director, and he like totally proves it here once again. I love the way he tells stories, and Shang-Chi is finally not just like every other mindless Disney film of their new big franchises. The action is worth it compared to other Marvel films, and the acting is to be expected as great considering at least Disney knows how to hire actors, albeit they don't let people often tell real stories. Go watch this! Somewhere! Anywhere! Everywhere!",23 November 2021

drpainters, Awesome.,"Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene. They mess up simply by trying to make the character 10 years younger then the actor is. But aside from that I thought it was awesome. Plenty of cool action fight scenes, goes a little off the rails at the end with way too much cgi for what was a relatively grounded movie to start. Great addition to MCU , especially after the quality level the shows have been.",3 December 2021
pepegomez65, Great new entry to the MCM,"A tad too heavy on the CGI and a bit too much wire work, making it more like ""crouching tiger"" in some of the fight scenes, but definitely one I'll enjoy re-watching.",18 November 2021
AziziOthmanMY, Crappy story line with a big budget,The story is scripted by some white dude that eats avocado toast on a daily basis and it doesn't add value to the MCU at all. Whats the point? Better watch suicide squad instead.,12 November 2021
DarioTheSweeper, A chinese tale.,"I was really looking forward to this movie after seeing the trailer. I decided to wait until it comes out on Disney+.What I saw surprised me deeply. This is a Chinese story that was probably made up by Marvel. In the movie there are a lot of fantastic beings which I really liked. The more I liked that it was a kind of karate movie. When I think about it, that was something new when it comes to Marvel. The main character seems personable and it's fun to watch his story unfold. What I can tell you is that this tells the story of how Shang-Chi got the ten rings. It is worth mentioning that the hero gained sympathy with me through his dealings with his best friend.To come to the conclusion I would like to say that this movie is very good and deserves more recognition. Ten stars from me because it's a movie I've been waiting for.",30 November 2021
adamjdavis-91950, A bit late getting to this.,"Personally this is top 3 comic movie.As a fan of Chinese cinema from the 70's onwards the martial arts in this film was fluid.Now if only DC would do a kung fu based film, it's got by far the greatest martial arts masters on its roster.Shiva, David Cain, Bronze Tiger, Karate Kid, Casandra Cain, Richard Dragon and on and on.Maybe a real film of soul of the dragon.",14 December 2021

ciobanualin-94020, A very well-made Marvel movie that deserves a lot of praise!,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the best productions of Marvel Studios. I had very big expectations for this movie and it didn't disappoint, mostly because it's based on asian people and martial arts and I am a very big fan of this genre. Only the idea to make a Marvel's movie which is based on martial arts is very interesting, even If there are already some comics on which this movie is based on.The movie has all you could expect from a movie made of Marvel, but the special effects and the CGI are the strongest points of this one. I even regret it that I didn't watch it in a cinema, because it's clear that the movie has been made to put into the light the enormous ammount of special effects, on a big screen. I've also been impressed by the acting and even the storyline it's not bad. It's clear enough that is has been put a lot of effort in the well-making of this movie and it seems to me that they really achieved what they've wanted to.""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" it's a movie that shines through it's CGI, acting and storytelling.",26 November 2021
mattrabbi," Not the most unique movie, but it's epic, action packed, and visually stunning!","I've watched this movie twice so far and I thought I'd enjoy it less on the rewatch, but I found it just as good.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a very epic introduction to this character and keeps you invested in his origin story. While it's definitely not the most original story, they do a good job at making the character relatable enough to keep you emotionally invested.Awkwafina was a nice addition to the movie and while some of her jokes were pretty corny, they still made me laugh (even on rewatch).The highlights of the movie are definitely the bus scene near the beginning and the final beautiful action sequence. But all the action in general in this movie is pretty amazing.While it has a different vibe than most MCU movies, the formula is definitely still there. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it would have been nice for this movie to have a bit more of a unique story.Otherwise this is a stunning cinema experience, and even watching at home it will make you feel like you're in a movie theatre. Definitely recommend!",17 December 2021
Christopher_Reid," Mediocre, shallow, flat - one of the worst MCU movies","I was excited for Shang-Chi. Infinity War and Endgame set the bar very high at the end of Phase 3. The MCU shows have been a mixed bag but Shang-Chi seemed exciting because the director has a decent track record and I hadn't heard of the character. I thought it would be a good way for the MCU to expand.But this is one of the most by-the-numbers superhero movies I've ever seen. Practically everything about it falls flat or feels superficial. The humour is obvious and lazy. The fighting is cool but the camera is too hyperactive to let me properly enjoy it. The CGI is over-used and seldom feels remotely convincing nor interesting.Although there's some backstory, it's boring and confusing. It's one thing to be told what happened in the past. It's much better if we understand why choices were made and feel the passage of time.As it is, I didn't relate to any of the characters much at all. Shaun and Katy are just annoying and frivolous. The villain is stubborn and not particularly intimidating. I probably liked Kingsley more than anyone else and his character could easily be removed without affecting the plot.The staging is incredibly artificial. So many shots contain characters simply standing in a line. Or walking in a line. It never feels natural. One part has the bad guys (Are they bad guys? Who cares?) park their jeeps in a row and then get out and stand in a row while the other army stand in, you guessed it, a row. This keeps happening.Some of the creature designs are kind of cool, like the dragons which look like stylised drawings rather than real creatures. But they lead nowhere. They aren't developed, nor hyped up before, just thrown in your face. Including the massive dragons at the end. To make a fight between giant, flying dragons boring is quite the achievement, but Shang-Chi pulls it off.Cliches abound in this bore-fest. The comedic relief sidekick learns archery in a day or two and saves the day with a ridiculous shot. Why didn't any of the archers who had years of training do the same thing? How can an arrow travel that far so easily? It cheapens everything. They didn't earn it, they just did it because that's what movies do, right?The physics are awful. Why do I care? Well, reality matters. I much prefer movies where things actually make sense than those where the pixels are having a seizure, characters say one-liners and there are no stakes or consistency at all. Ignoring physics means making up random events with no real danger, suspense or skill, on the part of the characters or the screenwriters.Shang-Chi is one of the most superficial movies I've seen for a while. Great entertainment for 10-year-olds, perhaps, but utterly dull to most true movie enthusiasts. The moments are forced and predictable. There's no magic, the music's forgettable, the acting and script tick boxes rather than engage you.At best, it has some colourful action and a few funny lines. It shows just how skillfully made good action movies are, including the Russo brothers MCU movies.",6 December 2021

ChanithaWeerasinghe, Beautiful MCU movie with crazy action scenes.,"Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is the 25th MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movie which also has the 1st major Asian representation in the MCU.I loved the film because it had an amazing story filled with a lot of elegant, eye-pleasing scenes and super awesome crazy action scenes such as the bus fight. The movie also includes amazing martial art techniques and beautiful Chinese things too.This film doesn't have recognizable adult stuff and very violent action scenes as many of the previous MCU productions had, which makes the film, ""Shang-Chi"" suitable even for younger kids like age 10. I didn't even feel the time passing by when I was watching this film because the story had an amazing flow with the stuff I mentioned before.

briancham1994," Solid first half, messy second half","I liked the first half of this film and I thought it was a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The backstory with the father and the mother was a nice wuxia inspiration and a cool way of introducing the Chinese theme to Marvel. The protagonist and Awkwafina had a believable friendship that struggled to balance enjoyment with living up to expectations. The tensed family relationship was a great focus as the father's gravity and charisma almost matched that of Thanos and feels like a truly deep human being. Throughout, the fight choreography was amazing, especially the bus scene.The second half was an obligatory CGI mess that takes the focus away from the family relationship. The epic legendary city of Ta Lo (Chinese version of Wakanda) is about thirty people living in a wooden village. That's all that stands between the world and a world-destroying demon, apparently. The hyped up final battle involves about ten soldiers with tasers. Wasn't the Ten Rings supposed to be a world-spanning empire? The fight between the dragons was so fast-paced that I couldn't tell what was going on.That said, there are flaws that occur in both of the halves. The Ten Rings (the organisation) is very vague in its nature and impact. Why are they so feared? How have they taken over the world? What are they capable of? Show, don't tell! The Ten Rings (the artifacts) don't seem to do much beyond flying around and projecting energy. This is cool, but it seems like a step down from other cosmic jewellery and probably didn't deserve the praise in the post-credit scenes.P. S. Trevor and Morris were definitely highlights of the film! Keep this up, Marvel!",28 November 2021
apoorvan22, Aesthetic,"Suffice to say, I enjoy all sorts of superhero movies. They're just so colorful with everyone dressed in otherworldly costumes and above all that, I even get to see creatures which don't exist and would never in my lifetime anyway. Shang-Chi was slightly different in the sense that thought it started off showing the past of an immortal man, it moved to modern-day America and focused on two friends who were as normal as any millennial you'd meet outside on the streets today. It got wierd soon after though, as it should.My favourite part of the movie was how the redemption arc for Ten Rings worked out perfectly, he really wasn't that bad as a father to begin with.I'm looking forward to more from this franchise.",26 November 2021

tendobear, Shang Cheese,"Totally unpopular opinion here and I might be the only one, but I really didn't like it; even going into it with no expectations. I wasn't too keen on the movie in the first place, but I was swayed by everybody who watched it and said it was brilliant. What a mistake. I felt the movie was incredibly dull, generic, utterly cliched and stereotyped. Crap characters, formulaic plot, and not even all that funny. As soon as the movie opened with a Chinese battle banner and the twang of guzheng notes, I knew it would be bad. The action and fight scenes aren't even all that great: they relied way too much on CG. I feel like the action was nothing special: Jackie Chan (and Yuen Wah whom you'll see in Shang Chi) in his hey-day produced way better action and fights without CG. Back when The Matrix first came out, that was mind-blowing action that Western audiences haven't seen before. If you've seen any number of Hong Kong martial arts movies you'll know what I mean. The third act of the movie was a total rip-off of the last battle in How to Train Your Dragon. Also an absolute waste of great actors like Michelle Yeoh who was given nothing to do, she practically dialled in her part. Positives though: Tony Leung. He's the one redeeming grace of this terrible and lazy movie.",30 September 2021
isaacochoterena, Works as an introductory movie but has a boring story,"This film manages to introduce the character in this universe, but the story that unfolds is boring.The conflict changes several times, it even takes the main character to a lake to concentrate on something else, it becomes cyclical, it is incongruous, it has many script holes, you do not feel much emotion when the fights appear. The visuals are very good, the editing is good most of the time, although the sound of some mythological elements is not very good, like the performance of the actor who plays the antagonist, the ending feels a bit forced.This film is not innovative in the genre and is predictable, making it somewhat boring.",13 November 2021
jacals-montfy," An bog standard introduction, albeit one that makes me excited for the future","I thought plot was slow and the acting of the main character a tiny bit dry, but it is such a stunning, visceral experience that intrigued me to the end.",24 November 2021
lomag330, Loved it,This was fantastic. Saw it in theaters then again as soon as it was out on streaming too! The story and characters were great to explore; the action sequences and special effects keep you immersed; and the actors all made the story come to life.,22 November 2021
beachside-60315, Fun and entertaining,Finally! A fun and entertaining movie without all the garbage Hollyweird offers. Great special effects and story line. Best movie I have seen since the Covid outbreak.,9 December 2021
jason-16503, Shang is lamest superhero of the decade,"The movie was entertaining to some degree and followed the standard Marvel Universe formula. Trite, current day pop cultural references and jokes during the first half of the movie were cheap and certainly will be lost on audiences of the future. A few idiots in the theatre guffawed loudly at most of them. As usual, though, the women were strong, kind and intelligent and the men were dumb and evil. Are we to believe that the most evil man in the Universe, Xi, is going to change his evil ways and that his wife would have even married a mass murderer on the scale of Genghis Kahn or Vlad the Impaler? Of course she's killed by his enemies and he returns to a life of evil and sends his henchmen to kill his own children to retrieve some necklaces so he can read a map. I will say Xi was a badass, as were Shang's sister, Aunt, and pretty much every other character compared to Shang, who was soft and definitely not superhero material. Awkwafina was funny and entertaining as usual, overshadowing Shang in most scenes as his character was so forgettably boring. Even his Aunt could kick his butt. Loved Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, extremely funny and his performance was genius. The outcome was the usual for Marvel Universe and even the pre-view for the next movie during the credits was lame; I guess they could only get Mark Ruffalo and Brie Larson, perhaps the only two Marvel Universe characters lamer than Shang, to set up the next movie.",5 September 2021
mattmaddock, A new standard!,"The goal of an MCU solo film is to sell the audience on a new character and power system. This movie does both perfectly, within the first 30 minutes we are drawn to Shang as a character and that lasts throughout the entire movie. The fight scenes have love and care poured into them and I hope they bring this team back for future MCU movies involving Shang because they pay homage to old kung fu movies beautifully.",2 December 2021
mitigatedmania, Stunning,"This movie was stunning. From the visual effects to the heart of the story to the phenomenal cast. I laughed, I cried and sat on the edge of my seat. Well worth taking the risk during the pandemic to go see this one in the theater. The music was great as well. Will definitely buy it when it comes out for rewatch. One of the best Marvel movies IMO.",7 September 2021

pensacolacomputer, When will Disney learn?,"I heard great things on the internet about this movie, so I had some pretty high expectations. Well, I was let down, and judging by the other reviews ALOT of other people were too. People are not going to put up with this crap for too much longer. I mean how many bad movies can Disney make in a row and expect people to continue to watch them?I see Disney even tried to even throw some Anti American talk into this movie to try to get on China's good side....but even that did not work. China did not allow their citizens to watch it. I guess Disney will have to put even more Anti American talk into the next movie.You messed up Star Wars Disney. Now you are messing up every Marvel movie. Maybe wokeness is not the way to go. PLEASE can someone buy Marvel from Disney before its too late??3/10 Another very poor Disney Marvel movie.",12 November 2021
timone-shimone, A must see for fans of martial arts action and Chinese fantasy,"What a great flick. The action was amazing throughout, constantly growing and changing so the fights never got boring. Awkwafina is a favourite of mine and did a great job. Family relationships really do make the most compelling of stories. We got an Antagonist that had a tragic and understandable story, he never felt 1 dimensional like so many other hero rising villains.",6 September 2021
melwinbauer, Beginning of Phase 4,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings takes place some time after Avengers Endgame is the beginning of phase four of the marvel cinematic universe.Shang-Chi is an alright movie. It has some great fight scenes with some incredible fight choreography and epic large-scale battles. It is also has some good comedic scenes that made me laugh a couple of times. Where Shang-Chi suffers is when it comes to the plot. I didn't find the story very compelling and I didn't get that attached to the characters. It's a story that I feel has been done many times before.Shang-Chi wasn't for me but it's comedy and fight scenes make up for some of it's flaws. If you are familiar with the Marvel franchise I assume you somewhat know what to expect and for you I can recommend it. Although the movie isn't that great, I still think it's good enough to the point of where it's worth watching just to keep up with the larger plot of the MCU. For those not invested in the MCU, I don't believe that this movie is the one you should start with.",23 November 2021
Svenstadt, A mish-mash of genres that don't work on the whole.,"The very first question to be asked would be, ""Why was this movie even made in the first place?"" It's one of those ones that tries to be too much and ultimately fails at everything. It starts off as a love story, then turns into ""Filthy Rich Asians,"" and then ends as a conventional action pic. A romantic feminist vibe is terribly present throughout the entire picture, which wouldn't be that bad if that was all it was about. But this movie has trouble settling on one single narrative. It's almost like an asian version of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" As is typical of this current generation of filmmaking, it's just another ""People running around doing things"" movie. The market is just saturated with these SFX garbage movies which this summer was full of!!",5 September 2021
PushtheagendasPLEASE, This movie surprised me,"Have not been a huge fan of the Disney/Marvel universe films as of late. But, this one was a shock to me.This film was very well done. It was great because they had a very ""Jackie chan"" feel to the movie with the rhythm and pace of the fight scenes. Which made sense because of the trainer and stunt coordinator. He was the one that worked closely with Chan throughout his career.The film was great because it steered clear of all of the ""PC"" B. S. and was just a great action superhero movie. It is all I want to see when I see a movie.The action was INCREDIBLE. The main actor and actress that played the sister were incredible to watch. The story was also not too predictable, so it made it enjoyable.I highly recommend watching this one to have it help kind of tie some of the old Iron man movies and some of the shows together.",10 December 2021
ininur, The Visual is Major,"The Vibe of this movie is really really ""Asian"" and that's great. The story is not like what i expected but i love it. The concept is a little bit similliar like Black Panther. The friendship between Shang-Chi and Katy is wholesome. Unexpected and contain a good messages especially for Chinese.The main thing that i really freakin love about this is the Visual and Music which is extremly amazing great! Gorgeous! Magnificent!",24 November 2021
Sleepin_Dragon, Wow!,"I was not expecting that, I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes, that was an out of date bagel, this was a four course banquet.Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but it's produced in such a magical way, it is stunning.I plan on seeing this again, just to understand a few bits a little more.Go and watch it, you'll love it, 9/10.",9 September 2021
benb231, Not a fan of Marvel movies but enjoyed this,This film felt refreshing and didn't feel too much like a marvel movie. Felt like I was just watching a mythological modern film.I had a good time watching it. Only downside was some of the CGI felt very rushed at some points. But Iwas willing to overlook it as I think it is worth the watch.,20 November 2021
replyswaraj, A lot like Chinese Xianxia novels but theres no you're courting death,"This is a really good uptake on a marvel movie. Its definitely not like other movies in the MCU, the different cultural aspect makes it a fresh approach and the action scenes are stunning. The story is marvelously portrayed, its a simple story but the direction is amazing and the screenwriting and the vfx team. They did a great job. I loved this movie.",21 November 2021
Em72, Not too bad...,"Overall this movie exceeded my expectations. I wish I had gone to see it in theatres because visually, this movie is stunning. All the fight scenes, especially the ending would have looked even cooler on the big screen.But stepping back and thinking about the actual story, it's kind of random, predictable at times and I'm not seeing how they're going to incorporate it into the rest of the MCU.The other thing is the fight scenes: the choreography, the cinematography, the effects, they were great, and I think they knew that, so they took advantage of it. During the first half of the movie there would be a new fight scene every fifteen minutes that looked fantastic, but seemed to last just a bit too long.All in all I liked it. The acting was pretty good, the pacing was reasonable, the soundtrack was unique and the visual effects were a strongpoint It was a good movie.",27 November 2021
pepesaguirres, Well done Shang Chi,"In terms of history, I think it has the essence of each Marvel movie that is to leave with more questions than answers, of course, of course they are the origin of the rings., The AWESOME post-credits scenes leave the window open to a possible sequel as well. From the character's entrance to ""the avengers"".I think this movie shows that the MCU is being renewed in this new phase and that it brings us many surprises, the scene where abomination and wong appear are incredible! The special effects are crazy, each marvel movie is improving in terms of visual effects.",26 November 2021

comicbookzookeeper, Mired by terrible cgi and choppy editing.,"The story overall is fine and typical with the MCU. Simon Liu is likable as the title character. He definitely has charisma. Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung are both welcome additions to the MCU. And having Ben Kingsley back was great. He steals all the scenes that he's in.Unfortunately, the cgi was terrible in this movie. It was so distracting. I wish things were shot on location. The green scene backgrounds were so obviously. The bus fight scene was boring because you could tell they were on a set with cgi roads and buildings in the back ground. The fight scenes are poorly edited and choppy. They are not coherent at all. And of course Awkwafina was miscast. She needs to stay away from movies.",6 April 2022
dominicwood-14504, Who knew a superhero film could be so beautiful?,"I'll start by saying that if you're looking for a great story, you'll be disappointed. Shang-Chi is a pretty standard hero's journey at its core, which is a shame because the story could have been inspired by House of Flying Daggers and other wuxia titles.So why a rating so high? Because where the story falls, everything else excels.Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the MCU. In regards to aesthetics, Black Panther walked so Shang-Chi could run a marathon.The fight scenes are all amazing. There's one weak fight, but it's meant to be weak, and they're all very long, which is great to see. One of the early ones went on for a solid 5 - 10 minutes, which was unexpected but far from disappointing.The first actual fight scene is my favourite in the MCU, and I was worried none of the others would top it, but they were all delightful to watch, and I was so glad they did a parallel of it later on. Either way, the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off.In summary, the story is lacking, but I'm glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine. And shine, it did. I hope future directors take lessons from the aesthetics and choreography of Shang-Chi.",4 September 2021
asb_deutsch, Visuals compensate for the lack of script depth,"One again the studio brings jokes and the dazzling visuals over a good character development. After one hour, you don't care for the characters. Dysfunctional drama in the family and the chosen one - we have seen this a million times.This is the first time I felt sleepy for an action movie. I feel like i wasted my money, despite availing the Super Tuesday offer. The Suicide Squad was far much better in terms of storyboard.Over-rated, like Black Panther

sunilsihag-50563, Average Marvel Flick!,"Great start, especially the fight choreography between Shang Chi's parents.

It was like they borrowed elements just for the hell of it.Expected so much...",28 October 2021
trashgang, great start but the fictionary world didn't fit in for me,"Started like a mix between martial art and the marvel universe. I found it something special and liked it a lot just until the journey starts and another world opens. From there on we came into a fiction world with dragons and monsters.It's there that this flick lost my attention towards the story. It takes a while before the action comes back in. But once the fights are on, the effects are really stunning.Mixed feelings aboutthe result, not bada fter all but with the other world coming in, it lost some points in the rating for me.Nevertheless, some funny parts here and there added and they worked out fine.Gore 0/5

Comedy 1/5.",14 November 2021
JATIN-1989, What's up with these extreme positive reviews?,"I watched this movie after Twitter was claiming it to be the best movie ever, so I went with high expectations, after watching what I found is movie was mediocre at best, the CGI was great but apart from it everything is just ok at the best, I didn't connect with any character at all. To be honest wait for the film to come on streaming services, not worth it to go to the cinema.",4 September 2021
Hannah_Bananah, MMA: Magical Martial Arts,"This story is more magical than most of the other Marvel hero adventures, so it's more like Doctor Strange than Iron Man. The magical elements in the movie were a refreshing change from all the aliens we've been seeing in Marvel movies lately. However, you can watch this movie without having seen any other Marvel movies before.The fight scenes were well choreographed, maybe almost too slick looking? They reminded me of Jackie Chan fights with how precise they were. Despite beating each other severely, no one seems to bleed in any of these fights, so it might have been better if it took the leap into R rating territory like Deadpool.Although some scenes had slightly janky looking CGI - it was only a little sub-par in places. The final action set-piece is epic though, proving Shiang Chi is a force to be reckoned with in the MCU.As with all the MCU movies, it doesn't take itself too seriously, with moments of humour. Although sometimes you'd wish they would be a bit more serious, I guess it's the MCU formula to add humour. It's reasonably well paced, although these movies are always longer than they need to be. Then you have to sit through end-credit scenes that hint at the mysterious origins of the 10 rings, and a potential sequel or tie in with another MCU movie.Overall, it's not bad, a good adventure, some good fights, and a BIG finish.",18 November 2021
nikiforoval, Disappointment,"People voted 8-10, rly? For what? Story line is primitive and the gaps filled with some martial arts. ""and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" there was no any legend at all, just rings which give some super powers we see them in the begging of the movie and at the end. Producers added Ben Kingsley and Benedict Wong to tailor Shang-Chi to other MCU movies, but it feels so disconnected like Billy Bob Thornton as a Santa in Bad Santa. Michelle Yeoh is playing Crouching Tiger again, it's so SAD that Hollywood does not give her non-kung-fu roles, she has talent for sure.In short, after 1hr I started to check my watch because the whole thing was so boring I just wanted it to end.",18 September 2021

bigalod, Great MCU origin story,"I just re-watched Shang Chi on Disney+, and I enjoyed it as much as I did the first time in the theater. This movie redefines action in the MCU, and I hope it carries over into the new films going forward.The first ten minutes are all in Chinese with subtitles. Yes, there is exposition and flashbacks in the movie as you're not going to understand the nuances of the plot, character motivations, etc. Without it. It's called storytelling. Get over it. There are references to cultural identity (as immigrants), family, and love.Awkwafina and Simu have great chemistry. Menger is badass. Tony Leung is a legend and gives a wonderful performance as a complicated and tortured antagonist. There is great humor (not to everyone's liking it seems) and heart. My only critique is really the usual devolvement into the CGI battlefest that MCU movies always wind up becoming, but that's a minor quibble in a solid movie.",12 November 2021
cliftonofun, Ben Kingsley FTW,"Ben Kingsley won this movie. And it was not particularly close. Probably the stunt coordinator came in a distant second? Anyway, I did laugh quite a bit, and the fight scenes were better than your average Marvel film...but not everything was better than average. Most of it was just about average, actually. Special effects: average. Characterization: average. Plot twists: average. I still enjoyed myself, and still appreciated Marvel transforming an exploitative property into something culturally rich. But the diminishing returns of Marvel joints continues.",13 November 2021

tturnitround, Highly recommended!,"Fun, solid blockbuster elevated by its sensitive treatment of culture and the migrant experience.

The soundtrack was also incredible.The film takes care to depict the lives of millenial Asian migrants, including all the karaoke (!) (Source: I am an Asian millennial migrant)Strongest point of the movie is the always-superb Tony Leung, who really brings the character of Wenwu to life.

william-eugensson, An American Chinese movie,"I liked this movie, one of the first American movie where a lot of the dialog is in Chinese. The movie in it self is not fantastic but is has it's moments. I just can't stop thinking about why this hd to be set in the Marvel universe, it makes no sense to me...but then I am no Marvel fan.

It feels like a generic kung fu movie and that we have seen it all before..

aleksanderk-95350, Shang-Chi,"I was really looking forward to this film, and was excited to see shang chi in the MCU. It started out good with an interesting father, and son character development. As the film continued, it seemed to rely very heavily on the CGI. After a while all the CGI felt bloated and overwhelming. The acting was well done, by everyone in the film no weak links. Was hoping this film, would have had a more grounded plot like Iron Man.",4 September 2021
wetmars, Reposting this review again.,"I had low expectations for this movie. First off, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. It's so god damn beautifully well-done. The storyline is extremely brilliant where it explores how this man found the Ten Rings that gifted him with unlimited power and immortality that kept him alive for thousands of years, would create an organization known as the Ten Rings who would later be responsible for the Kidnapping of Tony Stark in Afghanistan, Aldrich Killian's madness.After their job, the two ride on a bus, but only to encounter the Ten Rings and a guy with a ""freakin' machete"". I have to say, though. This scene's choreography was god damn great, and the music made it even better. After the attack, Katy begins to question Shang's motives. Shang explains the backstory of how he came to be, and that he needed to go visit his long-lost sister. They take the airplane to China. The two arrive in this underground fighting club that was broadcasted to the Dark Web only to encounter a guy who told him to sign to fight, even though Shang didn't know what he was signing up for. We get to see a cameo of the Abomination fighting Wong. I have to say that the CGI was better on him in every level. I am quite glad that the writers are starting to acknowledge The Incredible Hulk. Shang is up to fight an unknown opponent, and it is revealed that it is his sister. Shang tries to talk to her that he doesn't want to fight which basically led to him getting his *** kicked. (( Have to put asterisks so that IMDb won't delete this review, so don't be surprised. ))After the fight, Shang tells his sister, Xialing about the Ten Rings situation. They soon realize that the Ten Rings attack the club which leads us to another action scene. Unrelated, but I have noticed that people have been complaining that MCU Heroes don't kill. I'm pretty sure that they did kill since the beginning where Iron Man used his Mark I to light his victims on fire, blowing up multiple people, fatal blasts, etc. The Death Dealer steals Xialing's pendant, capturing the three of them to the Ten Rings Headquarters to reunite with their father waiting for them. Back at the Headquarters, Wenwu explains how there is still hope to save their mother by finding Ta Lo to save Ying. Wenwu uses the two pendants to place them on the dragon's eyes generating a map made of water showing them the secret passage through the bamboo maze, and the perfect time where it can be granted. Wenwu tells them that if the people of Ta Lo won't comply, he will burn down the village with no mercy. Shang is against this. Wenwu throws them in the catacombs. The three hear some weird noises only to encounter Trevor who was the Fake Mandarin in Iron Man 3! If you didn't know, there was a short that explains Slattery's experience in jail. In the end, he is captured by the Ten Rings. Morris comes out of the corner, telling Trevor the true path.Xialing discovers that there are escape routes, the team hijacks Razor's car which leads us to another fight sequence. They soon approach the bamboo forest maze. Katy is assisted where to turn by Morris and Slattery. Finally, they enter a waterfall, arriving at the Ta Lo village. Guang Bo tells the group to turn back. Ying Nan delays that order, meeting her niece and nephew. Although, I did realize this was Michelle Yeoh who portrayed Philippa Georgiou in Star Trek: Discovery. I do need to catch up as I lost interest. Ying tells them a story where in ancient times, their village was attacked by this extra-dimensional draconic entity who can suck the ever-living souls out of people and its minions can, too. But, the Great Protector, and sealed away behind the Dark Gate, trapping it for many centuries. Here, we have a training montage where we see Shang-Chi being trained in the same arts that were used to defeat Wenwu, Xialing practices with this what seems to be a rope dart, and Chen learning archery. The next day, Wenwu and the Ten Rings, also Razor Fist, and the Death Dealer arrive. Nan tells Wenwu that his wife isn't behind the Dark Gate, but the Soul Eaters were luring him to a trap.We begin the climactic third act. Nan fights with the Death Sealer, Xialing fights Razor Fist. Meanwhile, Shang notices his father walking away to his wife's memorial, but is distracted by several warriors for a brief moment. As he approaches his father, he told him that he isn't afraid. Episode V vibes here when Luke tells Yoda where he promises that he won't fail him and not be afraid. ""Oh, you will be. You will be."" They begin to fight until Wenwu uses the same movement that he killed the gang who killed his wife on Shang into the depths of water, believing that his son is dead. He does a Jedi Jump moment to the Dark Gates using the rings to break it down and free his wife. This makes the situation worse by releasing an army of Soul Eaters. In the village, Xialing tries to ally with Razor Fist to help to take down the Soul Eaters. His mind is changed when the Death Dealer's soul was sucked out, he tells the Ten Rings to stop and help the villagers. I have to say, this part was terrifying and how he falls dead, no movement. It is crazy how death does that. Back to Shang-Chi, he regains consciousness with the help of the Great Protector rising out of the water. The Great Protector begins to eat the Soul Eaters. Shang-Chi makes his way to his father to furthermore convince him that his wife isn't behind the Dark Gates. Wenwu ignores this, continuing the fight. Wenwu uses half of his rings at his son, but Shang catches them and gaining control of 'em. The fight gets more intense to the point where the Dweller is unleashed and slowly absorbs Wenwu's soul. During his final moments, he gives his son the rings. The battle suffered many losses including Master Guang Bo. Chen launches an arrow at the Dweller's weak port, causing it to be weakened. The Great Protector starts to kick the ever-living crap outta it, making it explode. In the Aftermath, the villagers attend a ceremony as the lanterns of those who died slowly ""swam"" across the ocean. Finally, it was all about a true story where Shang was explaining his recent adventure to a couple. Obviously, they don't believe him just until Wong uses his yellow sparkly thing bringing Shang and Katy to discuss the rings. We get a cameo of Captain Marvel and Bruce Banner. This time, Captain Marvel didn't get another haircut, lol. Interesting how Professor Hulk somehow returned to his human form. I strongly assume that his right arm is more painful since he returned as a human. In the end credits, we see Xialing becoming the new leader of the Ten Rings.There are A LOT of fantastic characters here. Starting off with Shang-Chi, I have to say that he had an excellent performance where he seems to be brave, showing no cowardice to his father, has lovely chemistry with his best friend he had known for 10 years, Katy, wants nothing to do with his family, often feels guilty for leaving Xialing. I have to say, though. Speaking of Katy, I liked how she wasn't full-on comedic throughout the film and became a badass. I do find it interesting that we have two archers now. Hawkeye and Katy. I quite like how we didn't have any romance (( besides Wenwu's romantic relationship with Ying Li. ))Wenwu. What to say on this. He is one of the best Marvel villains ever. Although, he wasn't one, and he had actual motives rather than being the usual MCU villain, but the storytelling is wonderful. He was a ruthless leader killing multiple people. Then one day, he stumbled upon a woman, ditches away his organization, became a better caring & loving man to raise two children until his wife was killed, seeking revenge on her murder, became a flawed father having no time toward his children like ditching Xialing. What. A. Tragic. Story. I am starting to notice that Phase 4 is exploring the effects of grief like Wanda's love for Vision, Sylvie's hatred for the TVA, and Corrupted Doctor Strange trying to bring back his love. Tony Leung's performance killed it. I loved how they were ditching away with the Mandarin stuff.I have to say that the Ten Rings (( no, not the organization. )) is completely badass, more interesting than the repulsors, the Mjolnir, Stormbreaker, a million-pound sharp-edged metal frisbee, the iconic Scepter, a cross-bow that can do many things, a prosthetic titanium/vibranium arm that can overpower almost anything, Quad Blasters that go pew pew, the Godslayer that can cut through anything, basic daggers, a laser cannon, yaka arrow that can travel by whistling, electroshock batons, carbon-fibered specialized winged jetpack, and vibranium claws. Wanda's psionic energy manipulation, size/insect manipulation, web-shooters, eldritch magic, and the Infinity Gaunlet are the only cool things along with the Ten Rings. You can make an energy blast, put 10 rings on one arm to do a super-punch, extend into a energy whip, shields, big jumps, etc. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. The fight between Wenwu & Ying was god damn jaw-dropping. Wenwu is a 10/10 character.For Xu Xialing, she became likable in the later halfs of the movie. Her backstory is heartbreaking, because of her gender, she couldn't train with her brother Shang. Although, she learned to train on her own. Rather than her unpleasant behavior, she has great bonds with women, emotional, a really interesting relationship with her brother. For Ying Nan, she is marvellous. She dealt with the loss of her sister, and wise. I enjoyed Guang Bo so much, he's wise, has a deep heart for his village. I was devastated of his death. Trevor. I enjoyed so much for him and his deep relationship for Morris, he is so fun! ""Calm down, mate. I'm not actually dead, it's just a performance, play along."" I do wish that the Death Dealer was done better rather than being treated dirty. He was badass, completely threatening, and the same potential of Taskmaster. The movie has excellent pacing, that's all I have to say.",26 November 2021
amritjogender, Omg! Wasn't expecting it to be so stunning,"The music, the screenplay, the writing, the direction everything was on point. I went to a theatre to watch it and was literally stunned. I crave that background music. It's simply too good. Ultimately. Go for it. Best 2 hours you'll have. Wont regret it.",13 November 2021
gaminggeekster, One of the best marvel movies yet!,"I was blown away with this movie! It reminds you of an old jackie chan movie yet still being modern enough to bring in a new audience. The acting is great, the special effects are amazing and the fight scenes.... OMG they are the best fight scenes I have ever scene in a movie!! And the soundtrack to go along with it is just perfect.All and all this is a great addition to the mcu and I'm excited to see where they go with Shang-Chi next in the mcu.",24 November 2021
dvsmalone, Must watch a second time,"After watching this movie in the theater, I thought, ""Wow, that was not what I expected, it was more visually appealing than I thought it would be"". At 2nd watch, I really was impressed how rock solid the story was. I loved the way they Humanized Xu Wenwu and made this a tragic love story. The acting was amazing when it came from the amazing actors (obviously). Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh are legends and acted accordingly. Simu Liu will rightfully be a superstar because of his performance. I want to see more of Meng'er Zhang, I think that she has huge potential. My only disappointment was how quickly Death Dealer died. Andy Le is an awesome performer.Combining everything, this may be my favorite Marvel Movie of all time... and I didn't even Mention Morris!",2 December 2021
Dude2021, Director and Actors were spot on,"As a Chinese American - I loved this film. They literally hit every thing spot on. I cannot think of anything else they could've done to make it better. Tony Leung is without a doubt Tom Cruise + Tom Hanks in the Chinese/Hong Kong movie community. I grew up watching his films. He was a perfect cast. The use of mandarin (Chinese) in this film was spot on as well, though the translation could be better. I understand Chinese mandarin, and it was spot on. Only thing I ask of Marvel/Disney is somehow bring Tony Leung back. And maybe help the general public on how to properly pronounce Shang Chi. (Sh-on-Chi). Seriously, this movie was just like Black Panther, everything was spot on. I've seen this movie twice in theaters, and bought 4k collectors edition. Marvel/Disney, please continue to take my money. Thank you for creating amazing content and do justice to the Chinese & Chinese American & Chinese abroad justice.",8 December 2021
Dello_, Boring,"I was really hoping to like Shang-Chi but I couldn't because of mainly three reasons: the first one is the most severe and it is the fact that I found myself very bored, especially in the last hour. I spent that time hoping that I could have the ability to skip 10 second at will like on YouTube. The second problem is the fact that Shang-Chi itself is not an interesting character as far as this movie treats him. He surely has potential and it is clear that Marvel will be high on him in the future and I still have hope but in this movie I think I preferred at least four characters more than him and he is the protagonist. And finally the plot has various holes, especially regarding the Ten Rings as a criminal organization. The visuals and the action are good but it wasn't enough for me to like this movie.PS: the mid-credit scene is the best of the movie, really liked that one.",6 September 2021
mike-27247, Good but seems familiar,"Well it is a good movie with a great cast, but the 10 rings( the weapons and the group) seemed secondary to the plot. Yes they were there but was not a driving force towards the plot. Marvel knew they dropped tge ball with the mandarin but buried it more with this. Seemed like they put ghostrider and and iron fist together. The villige is K'un-Lun in a sense. Mystic village that is only accessible during a certain time period. And the soul eater is pretty much dark heart from the nick cage ghostrider. Still a good movie, just borrow to much from other marvel properties.",27 November 2021
Professor_Jamie," Just, wow.","You could be mistaken for reading the title and thinking I was being sarcastic.Thankfully,I'm not. Just wow. I've been longing for that wow factor from the cinema since cinemas have reopened and this film gave me everything I wanted.Take away the fact that I am biased towards Marvel movies (guilty) this however is just a fanboy loving that Marvel have delivered once again, by that I mean top tier movies in the realms of Black Panther, Thor 3, GOTG, Infinity wars, Spider-Man just to name a few.From not having any major comic runs, to coming to our screens with this is jaw dropping movie, I can only show nothing but pure joy. From the culture, the mythical folklore, the mix of past/present and let's not forget the secret garden this film expands on the Marvel universe once again with an even deeper history.This film gave me real belly laughs, real emotional moment, a fantastic soundtrack to match this is a genuine winner for this year and Spider-Man may have his hands full beating what I can only describe as the best introduction to a unknown character since BP/GOTG. Shang-Chi needs to be a new staple in the Marvel franchise with new stories moving forward. Not to mention that fantastic performance from Simu Liu which has genuinely made me yearn for more of his portrayal!What an absolute treat and I've only watched it twice with a third viewing feeing more needed as the days go on.5 star all day, every day. Bravo!",24 September 2021
csheff3," Honestly it's great, beautiful martial arts galore","Haven't been much of a Marvel guy even with their biggest event films, but Shang Chi is solid. Story moves quick, lots of great characters, almost nonstop action scenes, and a finale that they hid from the trailers. I was definitely way more into it than I thought I'd be. Props to the team on this one!",4 September 2021
zohairkhan-42361, Waste of time..,This movie is centred around cheap laughs and gags. It takes all the bad parts of the old MCU movies and puts it into this film. A fart joke was the only thing left on the table.I literally feel asleep in the final act since it was so bizarre. This film drags on and on and on. In 2008 this would have been amazing. I'm shocked this carry's the marvel tittle. After end game Marvel had some excellent releases that continued to work on a wonderful story such as Wanda and Falcon but this was utter trash.If you wana watch an old school Kung fu movie then this is ok. I hope they don't drop the ball with externals tbh.I seen a few people leave the theatre. And what's up with these over the top good reviews seems sketchy.,11 September 2021
thegreenarrow-28184, Its Okay,"Its Okay, not great- the first half of the movie was better then the second half, they kind of lost me once they introduced all the fantastic beasts. I just want to know why i should care about Shang-Chi, would of been better to introduced him in a previous movie like endgame threw the portals- im sure in the future of the mcu this movie will become more relevant, and he will play a bigger part, but the sad truth is take away the MCU connections and i would not have even watched this movie.",1 December 2021

Izzy2727, Stop Disneying our Marvel Dammit,"Couple of things, 1. The actors are made of plastic, I know it wasn't a CGI cartoon but the actors were so one dimensional it may as well have been. Have never seen live actors display the uncanny valley. 2. Feels alot more like a Disney film and less like a Marvel super hero movie. 3. It was super formulaic, Awkwafina was as usually not funny and every little chuckle was super forced. Overall had some good fight choreography but you can get that in any other Kung Fu Movie. Kind of makes you wonder why so much money was spent on a very very very template movie. Kind of lame.",4 September 2021
sadrakhhutapea, Amazing story,"A very extraordinary story in a film production.Just an input, I think it would be very extraordinary if every country in the world opened several places to be used as places for promotion of new production, of course also with the language of that country. This is an example of a good film production but not a few do not know that this is a good film.",28 November 2021

luckyintheorder, Underwhelming in every way,"Stupid on every level. Fights are entertaining, but would rather watch any bad 70's chop socky movie over this poorly written, ludicrous story. Several of the characters are so unrelateable it makes me wonder if the writers, director or actors have ever met another person. Not worth the time to write this review except that somehow this is getting a 7.9 at this moment which cannot be real. IMDB should be embarrassed shilling for this mess.",17 October 2021
rrusso-64750, ignore the bad reviews!!,"Now one of my marvel favs (as a fan since the beginning!)- this movie is so beautifully written, the storyline is original and creative, and the acting is impeccable. Another phase 4 hit!!!",26 November 2021
jackson_ro, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"A simple yet surprisingly decent marvel flick that pays tribute to Chinese culture authentically with Western twists. As an Asian, the most wondrous part of Shang-Chi's cinematic journey is the inclusion of Chinese mythical creatures created with World Class CG. The action scenes are also reminiscent of the top Hong Kong martial arts movies. You have to remember that this is a Marvel Studios movie, so do temper your expectation for the storyline a little, its more style over substance. My biggest gripe is the casting. We've been waiting to see Asian Super Heroes on a global stage, I just find it hard to believe that it is Liu Simu who has very little charisma, and seems way out of his league for this big of a role. Awkwafina provides great comedy relief, and is a fantastic addition to the Marvel Universe, I also find it unfair for the Asian community that she is built to be the love interest. Is it this difficult to sexualize Asians in Hollywood?",21 November 2021
ollivernick, more of a childrens movie,"I enjoyed the idea, going for a crouching tiger, hidden dragon vibe but it just lacked authenticity. Really bad over acting and cheesy action with dated CGI i swapped over to listening to music while watching it and i enjoyed it much better.",11 November 2021
kinejin, Kinejin,"Incredibly boring and indifferent film, with stereotypical characters and a predictable story, following the superheroes formula. I watched the 3-D version, which looked like bad animation and completely distanced me from the film. The only redeeming qualities were a few inspired shots and the inclusion of some decent actors -- especially the wonderful Michelle Yeoh.",19 September 2021
SnoopyStyle, MCU and funny,"Shaun (Simu Liu) and Katy (Awkwafina) are slackers in San Francisco. Well, they're Chinese slackers which means that they still have jobs. They're just dead-end jobs. Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun's real name is Shang-Chi and he was trained from childhood to fight by his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who has been conquering for a thousand years with the Ten Rings until he met the love of his life, Shang-Chi's mother.This is MCU doing an Asian hero and it's actually pretty funny. Awkwafina does her comedic thing. Simu Liu does a good every-man performance but he's also a good straight man to Awkwafina. I like the pairing although they may be better as friends. Then the movie surprises with a comedic turn from Ben Kingsley. I love that part which gave the movie a comedic jolt. I wouldn't mind him popping up in other MCU stuff. The dragon fight is a little blah but those climatic battles are getting standardized anyways. This is a fine addition to the MCU and these are fun characters to add to the gang.",2 March 2022
meeeshall-932-44275, Fighting scenes were really good,"Obviously this film is heavily Americanized, but the martial arts were so beautiful and well done! I haven't seen fighting scenes like that for a hot minute and it brings me back to my childhood, like watching Jet Lee, Michelle Yeoh, and Jackie Chan. I really wish they spoke more mandarin in specific scenes though. The English made scenes weak to me personally, idk being threatened in English didn't cut it, but when the villain threat the elder in mandarin, that hit different.Overall, I loved the movie and am so proud that an Asian protagonist is in the MCU. I understand they want the movie to appeal to Americans, but I'd wish they keep the movie a bit more Asian traditional than super Americanized lol.",21 November 2021
cdnboy, No idea what anyone else is watching.,It's the same old at this point with these movies. Unoriginal plot. Story is bland. Predictable and the jokes are just recycled now. No idea how you could give this more than a 6 out of 10.Really wasn't impressed at all.,13 November 2021
parkercpk, Loved it,Asian representation without compromising on storytelling. Great cinematics and CGI. Can't wait to see what the Marvel team delivers next. Perfectly executed!,21 November 2021
nishantsalhotrans, Best non-avengers MCU movie,"Keeping it short. This movie had it all. Great story, writing, direction, acting, villain, comedy and fight direction.I'm a huge old school kung-fu movie fan and I was a bit sceptical about how they will show the fight scenes. Glad they kept it authentic with the fight director (who worked with Jackie Chan a lot). It was insane.The story itself was superb. The villain's character development was amazing. The direction was not rushed and at the same time it didn't bore me for a single second.Best non-avengers MCU movie for me. I can watch this again today after watching it last night.",6 September 2021
degrees-33365, Pretty but still yet another paint-by-number Marvel rubbish,"The movie looks great but...the story and how it is being moved forward is so predictable I could almost call out every 'event' before they even happened.Marvel is a in a creative rut. Every movie they put out is 'pretty and shallow'. I mean, I like empty calories as much as the next person - but that doesn't mean I can sit and eat a pound of it - which is exactly what watching a Marvel movie translates to.2/10.Wish I had watching something completely different.",10 November 2021

rockinkettles-1, Shang Chi was disappointing,"Don't believe the praise for this movie. Marvel fans who liked it have got to be kidding. They always trash DC movies but they liked this? I don't get it. But then that is typical coming from Marvel fans. It is not the Shang Chi I remember from the 70's comics. It would have been better if It took place in the 70's and had more of an Enter The Dragon vibe. What we get is anything but. It has some good action scenes, the best being with Shang fighting men on a bus. But then it has Ben Kingsley who was out of place in it and a furry creature called Morris that was stupid and unnecessary and should have been ommitted from the movie. It's like a furry pig with wings with no head or face that makes sounds like an Ewok or Gizmo from Gremlins. So dumb. There are some amusing moments but then I find it irritating that something funny has to be thrown in at odd moments. Like most Marvel films. Give it a break. Please. The ending is something out of a Rodan, Godzilla movie. When watching this I thought is this really a Marvel movie or a B movie from made in Japan. I did like the first half of Shang Chi. The second half was just ok. I saw it free because I had a free ticket from my club card. I'm glad I did. Even when I saw the trailer I wasn't expecting anything. I can see why. My opinion is to see this on tv. It is not one of Marvel's best. And those who praise it and say that it is are kidding themselves. Gimme a break.",20 September 2021
eldreddsouza, Worst story and plot ever.,This is by far the most nonsensical plot in a Marvel film and one of the worst stories I've ever witnessed. It's so hard to make sense of anything at all in this film. The only good thing is some of the action sequences. Bus fight is spectacular but after that it goes completely downhill cause only after that does the plot actually unfold. And it is so ridiculous and so full of nonsense that I was thoroughly bored whenever anything other than the fight scenes were on.I think Marvel is done. This phase seems completely relying on the success of the previous one. The only good thing is Spider-Man and I'm eagerly looking forward to No Way Home. After this I don't have any expectations from Marvel films other than Spider-Man.The humour in this movie is pure cringe. It feels too forced and Awkwafina is completely out of place. The last scene where they sing Hotel California is so damn cringy. It's a tragedy that they thought people would enjoy it. This is a really bad film minus the action sequences. Watch it only for the action which looks good on the big screen. Don't have even the slightest expectation from the story.,18 November 2021
lakings97, Great Visual Effects,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the latest Marvel superhero movie that stars Simu Liu as Shang-Chi who is forced to confront his past after he was drawn into the Ten Rings Organization headed by his father played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung. Shang and his sister Xialing played by Meng'er Zhang had witnessed their mother's death and work together to avenge her legacy and to protect the lands that her people came from. The plot was fun to watch with great visual effects and great supporting cast that also included Awkwafina as the hero sidekick along with Michelle Yeoh who helps train Shang the ways of his mother's unique way to defend. After all these years we now learn what happened Ben Kingsley and how he ended up with the organization after his encounter with Iron Man. Overall great movie with a wonderful cast, definitely add this to your must see list.",20 February 2022
amongthylacines, Very mediocre.,Another very mediocre movie from this dying 'universe' but some fight scenes are quite good and visual it's mostly ok too. Better than Capt Marvel. Hence the two points.,7 September 2021
wgeddings, A return to good Marvel movies,"If you are like me, from the previews and ads you thought this was a Kung Fu movie about a son rebelling against his crime lord father and the father sends men to force him to return and make him take over as the next leader of the criminal empire. Not an awful plot but not that original either. That is absolutely NOT what this movie is about. I love and hate that Marvel's trailer seldom give anything away and I am glad they are doing it again. That is not at all what this movie is about and I will not spoil anything.The performances are good, the story is good and while not complicated, it keeps your interest. Funny parts, touching parts, action parts, it is overall just a good movie that was enjoyable to watch. It is not one of the best Marvel movies but it is a solid one and worth seeing in the theater.",5 September 2021
kosmasp, Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema! Well done!",12 September 2021
kuner-59029, Bad acting in a nauseating CGI crapfest,"The first thing that jumps out at you here is how uneven the acting is compared to the usual Marvel movies. Actors alternate between overacting, pathos and subdued attempts at coolness. Add the usual Marvel style self-referential wink wink humor, and the obligatory 30 minute CGI showdown with purple light themed villains and monster (for the... 15th time now?), and you end up with a jarring, nauseating tonal mess of a movie.It's the same movie over and over again, same exact story beats, same pacing, same style soundtrack, same jokes, same trashy special effects laden battle at the end.They tried to gimmick things up with Kung Fu here (because that's apparently what Disney think people want to see in movies with an Asian cast), but you've seen it all before dozens of times, and better at that. The martial arts fight in public transport has been done to death (recently quite well in ""Nobody"", but also in Marvel films like Captain Marvel), and in general the fights pale against movies like Matrix, John Wick or any Jackie Chan classic.The reality is that Marvel movies feel dated and played out, with nowhere to go except from one CGI battle to the next. Maybe Marvel would be better off switching to a series format, because the movies are just reheated microwave dinners at this point.Save your money for something original.",4 September 2021
roxmewild, Not Marvel ous,Marvel are in desperate need of good writers!The story and script are both confusing and beyond cheesey !It really saddens me as I was once a big Marvelfan but since the passing of Stan Lee and Disney taking over it has produced a lot of trash!The Marvel I once enjoyed will never be the same it has been turned into yet another Disneyfied production.,13 February 2022
basementbrotherscollectibles, Highly Overrated and Forgettable MCU Film,"Shang-Chi is another bad and boring addition to Marvel's weakest Phase in the MCU (Phase 4). It made less money at the worldwide box office than Godzilla versus Kong in the same ""pandemic era."" The lead actor is boring in the film and pretentious outside the film...mocking fans, berating any constructive or genuine criticism, and spouting a bunch of foolishness on his social media that may get him canceled in the near future by one of the many angry Twittermobs. He basically is the male Brie Larson of the MCU. What could have been an action-packed, fun, exciting Kung Fu film in the MCU collapsed into a lame CGI-fest in the third act--think of the Dragon Ball Z or Avatar films that bombed at the box office. Once again, we had an overpaced origin story...watching Shang-Chi go from being an insecure valet, to getting kicked in the balls by his sister while shirtless in a cage fight with her...despite him being the ""Master of Kung Fu,"" only then to ""saving the universe"" in the third act...all in his first film...while also confronting his feelings and emotional issues with his father. He learns how to use the Ten Rings in a matter of minutes without any learning curve, which is ridiculous, and duels an evil dragon with his own good dragon. The rings aren't even the Mandarin's rings from the comics, but rather ten mystical bracelets. The supporting cast is forgettable, and the jokes are dryer than cracker-juice. Even Michelle Yeoh's star power is wasted and forgotten--most people don't even know she's in this film, which is a shame as she has helped pave the way for these lead and supporting actors and actresses in the film. The supporting actress Awkwafina feels outdated already, even though she just seems to be breaking onto the film scene as ""Marvel's Katy."" There is very bad chemistry between Shang-Chi and Marvel's Katy...what could've been a romance with a different, more competent actor/actress pairing and writer was more of the ""friend-zone"" at best. You definitely don't root for these two to fall in love and wonder if they even would. No chemistry, no tension...fully neutered...or possibly closeted (for now) to pander to a Chinese audience whose government wouldn't show the film in spite of pandering to them. Finally, Shang-Chi's sister is the real master of Kung Fu because she managed to become a better fighter than him, start an entire fight club in another country, all by watching him train and fight with Kung Fu masters while the patriarchy in her culture prevented her from studying martial arts with her brother. She learned her fighting skills all on her own...in the shadows at night-time...welcome to the ""M-She-U""...again...",3 November 2021
IliescuVictor, Out of the Marvel patterns,"I had very few expectations from this one, given the fact that it was an origin story with a character I know zero facts about. But let me say this, it competes with the Avengers movies when comes to cinematography, visuals and action sequences.By far the best Marvel movie in the recent years, that puts many titles from its portfolio to shame.The visuals are a blast, a true eye candy experience. There are a lot of new elements that Marvel seemed to experience with and it worked out perfectly. The choreography is spot on, as the fighting sequences are among the best I've seen, and combined with a good score, it turns out to be a very enjoyable seeing on the big screen. I think it's mandatory to watch Shang-Chi on the biggest screen you can get to.",2 September 2021
mohfawaed, A funny and good movie for action genre.,"As a non-marvel fans, I give this movie with 10/10 score, beside the good acting and fighting style, I found this interesting culture where the Chinese fiction culture was storied.Moreover, I watch this movie because there's one of my favorite actress, yeah she is Awkwafina who always look like silly wherever she roles any movie.Oh yeah one more thing, honestly, all the fiction animals on this movie are disgusting.",20 November 2021
digitalbeachbum, Not bad,"The opening fight scene is worth the watch, but the cameos steal the show. I won't go in to detail. The Marvel geeks will know what I mean, because there are plenty to count even the hidden ones.The movie is good and I like the casting. The direction is okay but the cinematography is the best.The ending is anti climatic. I found it to be cliche. However it is worth the watch.

kian_soltani, ALMOST a Superhero-Masterpiece,"This movie is really good! In fact the first half of the movie is almost flawless. Incredible combat scenes and a great family drama story set-up which promises an emotional climax and confrontation.SPOILERS:Where the movie fails to become a masterpiece is the last 20 minutes. Throughout the whole movie the conflict between father and son is at the forefront and is the real emotional driving force of the story. And what a great idea for a superhero movie to tackle such a deep and relatable topic.There is even an important line of foreshadowing by Shang, the evening before the final battle: -I'm going to kill my father-. What a strong statement and what a setup.But then the climax of the movie turns out the be a fight between 2 dragons.. the father dies by pure bad luck couple of scenes earlier.. killed by a random monster.A HUGE MISSED OPPORTUNITYIf they had kept the emotional conflict and the father&son dynamic as the climax of the movie, it COULD have become a masterpiece, which would have been more then just a great super-hero movie, it would have become timeless.HERE'S MY PITCH FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES:1) the father tries to open the gate. Shang-Chi fights him. Shang gradually wins the upper hand in the battle as he taps into his mothers skills.The father doesn't give in and continuously tries to open the gate. -If you want to stop me, you'll have to kill me- he yells. Now Shang-Chi is confronted with the moral dilemma of choosing to save the world or the life of his father.2) Shang-Chi choses to defeat his father, however he doesn't kill him just wounds him badly and takes the rings off him.It is too late however, the gate has Already opened and the monster comes through and goes straight for the village3) The father realizes his mistake and has a moment of emotional breakthrough as he realizes his wrongdoings and how he has let his son down as a father. He asks for forgiveness. They exchange a few deep words before Shang rushes off.4) with the help of the rings and the village dragon Shang-Chi manages to defeat the Monster.5) The gate is still open and it needs to be closed. It gets established that closing it also kills the person who does so.6) Shang doesn't hesitate for a second and rushes to the gate to sacrifice himself. Just before getting there his father pushes him out of the way and closes the gate in his stead. He dies saving his son and everyone else and redeems himself and ultimately heals the broken bond he had with his son....aaaaand scene.Now THAT in my eyes would be a worthy arc for the father and emotional climax which pays off the great build up the movie does.",24 November 2021

jboothmillard, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe made a big impact with an almost all-black cast in Black Panther, then this film came along and gave the world its first high-profile Asian superhero, and from the trailer I saw, it looked very exciting. Basically, thousands of years ago, Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) discovered ten mystical iron rings, granting its user immortality and other great powers. He establishes the Ten Rings organisation and throughout history conquers kingdoms and topples governments. In 1996, wanting to expand his power, Wenwu goes in search for Ta Lo, a mystical heavenly realm inhabited by Chinese mythological creatures. He travels through a magical forest to the Ta Lo village entrance but is stopped by guardian Ying Li (Fala Chen). The two fall in love, but Li leaves with Wenwu when he is rejected by the villagers. Wenwu abandons the Ten Rings, and they have two children, Shang-Chi and Xialing. When Shang-Chi is seven years old (Jayden Zhang), Li is murdered by Wenwu's enemies, the Iron Gang. Wenwu once again wields the rings to massacre the Iron Gang, resumes leadership of his organisation, and has Shang-Chi go through brutal training in martial arts. Xialing from childhood (Elodie Fong) secretly copies this training. When Shang-Chi is fourteen (Arnold Sun), Wenwu sends him to assassinate the leader of the Iron Gang. But Shang-Chi is demoralised after fulfilling his mission and decides to run away to America, settling in San Francisco and changing his name to ""Shaun"". In the present day, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) works as a valet with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina), who knows nothing about his past. They are attacked on a bus by the Ten Rings, led by high-ranking agent Razor Fist (Florian ""Big Nasty"" Munteanu) who steal a pendant that Shang-Chi was given by his mother. Wenwu anonymously provides Shang-Chi with the location of his sister and, fearing that the Ten Rings will go after Xialing's matching pendant from their mother, Shang-Chi decides to meet her. He reveals his past to Katy, who insists on helping him. They find Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) at an underground fight club in Macau, which she founded after escaping from Wenwu. The Ten Rings attack the fight club and Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant. They are taken to the Ten Rings' compound, where Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a magical map leading to Ta Lo. Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling to him and believes she is alive and being held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. He plans to destroy the village unless they release her. When Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy object, Wenwu imprisons them. Also incarcerated is former actor Trevor Slattery (Sir Ben Kingsley), whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating Wenwu, as The Mandarin, and his hundun companion Morris, who offers to guide them to Ta Lo. The group escapes and travel to Ta Lo, which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese mythological creatures. They meet Ying Nan (Michelle Yeoh), Li's sister, who explains the history of Ta Lo: thousands of years ago, the village was attacked by the soul-consuming Dweller-in-Darkness and its minions but was saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector who helped seal the Dark Gate to the Dweller's world. According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness has been influencing Wenwu to believe Li is still alive so that he will open the Gate. Shang-Chi, Xialing, and Katy join the villagers in training and preparing for Wenwu's arrival, using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales. Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi and forces him into the nearby lake, then destroys the Gate with the rings. Some of Dweller's minions escape, and the villagers join forces with the Ten Rings to fight them. Shang-Chi is revived by the Great Protector, which leaves the lake to battle the minions. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once more, with Shang-Chi gaining the upper hand, but he chooses to spare his father. The Dweller-in-Darkness escapes the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves his son, bequeathing him the rings before being killed by the Dweller-in-Darkness. The Dweller-in-Darkness is eventually killed by the combined efforts of Shang-Chi, the Great Protector, Xialing, and Katy. Following the battle, Shang-Chi and Katy return to San Francisco where they are summoned by the sorcerer Wong (Benedict Wong) to the Sanctum Sanctorum. In a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson). They discover that the ten rings are emitting a mysterious signal. In a post-credits scene, Xialing becomes the new leader of the Ten Rings after telling Shang-Chi that she was going to disband the organisation. Also starring Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon, Tsai Chin as Waipo, Yuen Wah as Master Guang Bo, Jodi Long as Mrs. Chen, Dallas Liu as Ruihua, Paul He as Chancellor Hui and Tsai Chin as Katy's grandmother, with the voice of Tim Roth as Abomination. Liu is suited nicely as the lead hero, Awkwafina is loveable as the hero's high-spirited best friend, Leung is interesting as the half-hero half-villain father, and there is good support from the likes of Yeoh and Kingsley. It is a simple story of a young man who must confront his past and use his mastery in weaponry-based Kung Fu to save the world, the highlights are the fight on the speeding bus and the final epic battle featuring dragons and mythical monsters, I agree the excellent special effects may swamp a lot of what is going on, but a well-written script, many fast-paces sequences, moments of humour, and nods to past martial arts movies help to smooth things out, all together it is an entertaining superhero fantasy action. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Good!",19 September 2021
MiroslavKyuranov, Absolute Banger!,"That was a freakin' blast! The story is complex and interesting it fills some gaps in the MCU and simultaneously is a great origin story for the character of Shang-Chi.The whole cast is amazing, I mean there is so much chemistry between them. Simu Liu and Tony Leung are phenomenal in their respective roles. The Mandarin tho...so well created character.The movie is amazing bridge between East and West culture. There is so much to explore, much like Wakanda. The history of Shang's culture is so rich.The fight choreography is absolute kick in the gutts...in a good way. I mean this is something completely new for the MCU and they deliver it again! Everything looks so goddamn good and I can't help myself thinking about some scenes! Also, the colors, the effects, the camera work and etc. Everything is magnificent.There is humor for sure, but there is also emotional impact. This is not some bland action packed movie, it's made with heart from fans for the fans. Kudos to the director Destin Cretton!Killer soundtrack and the main song for the movie ""Run It"" fits so good with all.There are a few surprises, that were hidden from the promos and trailers and man...just wait to see them.About the credit scenes...they are two, both are good, but one of them is...SICK!For sure deserves more than one viewing in the cinema, so much story building, details, action, fun. The people who underestimated this movie will be so surprised how great is it.",1 September 2021
dhruv-06565," Over-rated, like Black Panther","Before anyone thinks I am a straight white male who is not allowed to have opinions- let me tell you I am asian myself.

Ginsengjin, Basically Marvel version of Tokyo Drift,This movie isn't really written that well. It's more hilarious especially if you know what's going on in China and how MMA fighters go around debunking Chinese martial arts and the government is stepping in to censor it for the sake of protecting their pride / propaganda. Shang-Chi basically felt like an extension of that.The acting is overexaggerated and to be honest the movie forces more stereotypes on Asians than relieve it. At least actors like John Cho plays roles that puts an even footing with their other counter parts. This movie is more of a marvel's attempt to please the Chinese market for profit. Best way to describe this movie is it's 90's nickelodeon kid show acting combined with Tokyo drift level of Asian stereotype. There's not one scene where they're not bringing attention to the fact that there are Asian people in the movie. It feels very California in only the worst ways possible.,13 November 2021
hannaplokker, One of the best marvel movies ever with the best special effects!,"Marvel keeps making better movies! This marvel era is marvelous,(pun intended) first the series, then the black widow movie and now this! This movie has such lovable characters, the hero shaun doesn't have a hero complex like iron man. And the women who play in the movies are all different. In the beginning of marvel women (in my opinion) were displayed as either a strong power woman or a sex object. Here the women are just themselfs. The storyline is something new for me, I never heard about these stories and legends before. But now I plan to do that way more often. It was a little disappointing that all the 'good' main characters survived without a scratch. Of course I am happy that they will return in these movies in the future, but it makes it less dramatic and realistic. Still it is a funny movie with a great storyline and i cant even begin to mention how great the visuals were and the special effects. One of the best marvel movies for sure!",7 October 2021

markosepjr," Black Panther, but better","I wasn't really excited about MCU when Phase 4 was announced, but even then there were some things I was excited about and this movie wasn't one of those things. However, I liked it.I wasn't disappointed like I was with Black Widow which massacred Taskmaster so bad.It reminded me a lot of Black Panther. Non-white foreign protagonist, modern music and annoying sidekick.But here is a twist. This movie does a way better job than Black Panther.Humor was funnier, Katy didn't say anything cringe, we got real Mandarin and CGI battle didn't feel like PS2 cutscene.If you want to watch an MCU movie from Phase 4 before No Way Home comes out, watch this.Also, Eternals was awkward.",21 November 2021

ivanmessimilos, It was ok movie,"Solid pop corn film. Although the director tried not to look like a standard Marvel movie, I think he only succeeded to some extent. The first half of the film was very good, the story, and especially the impressive fight scenes. However, later in the film we constantly get some new elements, the story expands, there is not always an explanation, and the worst part of the film was my last fight because I think they went too far with special effects, for me personally it was not watchable. The bad guys overall were just solid, nothing special. Of course, at the end of the film we have a scene that shows us how to look for (at least) another film.",15 November 2021

After a fight on a bus where Shaun reveals himself as a martial arts fighter, the two of them travel to China so he can reunite with his sister (Meng'er Zhang) after six years. He was raised to be an assassin and to make a long story short, the opening sequence comes into play as they have to save the world.Marvel has done it again with graphics, special effects, characters, and the right blend of humor. I fell in love with Katy who was our voice of reason and comedy. I was so afraid they were going to Emma Stone her to death.

wumbi, Overhyped garbage,"Yet another lame superhero movie. Their decision to really explore into the family conflicts is nice, though the whole thing is still very cliche. There's no personality in the main character beyond that he is Asian. I really hate the score, all of them are garbage asian trap music. It was fairly hard to sit through, the whole 2 hours felt like 2 days. There's no risk nor consequences in the action scenes, they're all really tame. Some lines are extremely corny and the frequent flashback ruined the movie, that also shows how lazy and uncreative Marvel is at storytelling. Spending all their budget at crappy costume, big star actors and special effects while forgetting everything else.",14 November 2021
gavinp9, Enjoyable action film,"'Shang-Chi & the Legend of the Ten Rings' (or SCLTR?) feels like the proper start of MCU's phase 4, with a clear link forming to 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'. We're first introduced to what seems like a Chinese fairytale, as we follow Wenwu (Leung) and his millennium of power with 10 enchanted rings/bracelets. We then meet Li (Chen), who turns out to be the mum of Shang-Chi (Liu) & Xialing (Zhang).How the mystical realm of Ta Lo fits in and it's secrets aren't revealed until the third act, and after the intro, the film does well to show Shang-Chi & Katy (Awkwafina) living their somewhat unfulfilled lives in San Francisco, before the action starts to heat up when Shang-Chi goes looking for his sister. All the actors are very likeable, especially Leung, who does a great job of making sure Wenwu doesn't descend into a caricature of a bad guy, but truly feels like a misguided father. Some great cameos also round everything out and it's always great to see Michelle Yeoh.While a bit slow in some parts, the martial arts scenes and action near the end are great, without being overwhelming - certainly up there with 'Hero' & 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. Also a nice nod to 'Raya & the Last Dragon'! Nice ending and character arc for Shang-Chi - I look forward to seeing him find his place in the MCU.",1 September 2021
moviesknight, MCU widens,One time watch. Too fast of a character transition in 2 weeks even for superhero movies standards. Some nice action scenes.

MrSAsheC, Honest: A decent movie but don't expect anything you haven't already seen from Marvel.,"It's a decent movie. Happy that the comedic timing in certain scenes isn't overdone and it plays out to be a little more serious. The Mandarin in the movie by far the best acted out character and the choreography of the martial arts is on point. The movie is probably about 15 mins too long just when you think ""oh it's finishing up"" there's more. There is a notable difference in the second act with the story going more rapid and pacing is definitely the movies biggest flaw. Acting wise it's cool, nothing amazing or something you haven't seen before.If you're familiar with marvel it's the exact same model as some of the other movies with it being about family (Thor, Black Widow).Wanna have a good time with the family or just a decent watchable movie?

Other than that - this is the normal generic Marvel phase 2 dross.Oh, and Awkwafina is unwatchable! She's more like an irritant than an actress.P. S. I'm incredibly suspicious of the o.t.t.

Some might find it over the top but it's a Marvel so what do you expect? To me this is one of Marvels best movies yet if not the best. The acting was good as well, and that from the whole cast. I never heard of Shang-Chi before but from now he has one more fan. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings won't disappoint a lot of people, unless you're just not into this genre of movies.

Chrispearce2, CGI Festival,The plot was averagely old hat and covered ground that has been well trodden before. The film relied far to much on CGI which IMO which detracted from the film. Not the best marvel film.,13 November 2021
classicsoncall," ""If you aim at nothing, you hit nothing.""","There seemed to be a lot of inconsistencies in the story line, and that brought the film's credibility down a notch for this viewer. For example, during the insane bus fight scene, wouldn't you say that the Razor Fist (Florian Munteanu) was trying to kill Shaun (Simu Liu, before he was revealed as Shang-Chi)? That's what it looked like to me, but later it turned out that he was a strong arm for Shang-Chi's dad, Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). Wouldn't Wenwu be just a little PO'ed if the Razor guy actually hurt his son?Then there's the question of Shang-Chi's martial arts ability. After dispatching how many dozen fighters on the bus and on the scaffold, he gets blown out by his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) at the Golden Daggers Club. How? Similarly, Auntie Nan (Michelle Yeoh) doesn't have much trouble showing him what's what with her more elegant, flowing martial arts style. It seemed like Shang-Chi's ability got progressively worse as time went by, until the finale required him to rise to the occasion. And I can't for the life of me figure out why film makers can't make sure characters who use a bow and arrow get it right with the grip. When Katy (Awkwafina) takes up her archery practice, she squeezes the nock of the arrow between her fingertips, which is almost impossible with a high tension bow. The proper method calls for placing the nock between the index and middle finger on the bowstring. It allows for more accuracy, and you don't wind up with the arrow swinging up and down on the bow as you're trying to release it.Well, I guess that's enough ranting. The CGI special effects were quite astounding, I especially liked the colorful mythical creatures of Ta Lo. The martial arts sequences were exceptionally well choreographed as well, even though we know what's seen on screen is impossible in real life. The story itself was very much a rehash of hundreds of martial art film plots, which almost always seek vengeance for the death of a father, mother, mentor, master, take your pick. Even with that, it's an entertaining picture to watch, as the Ten Rings concept is given time to play out here, and in the expected sequel as well. As for that, the very final after, after, after credits scene appears to position Xu Xialing as the replacement for her father Wenwu at the head of the Ten Rings organization. We'll have to wait and see how Shang-Chi manages to deal with that whole scenario.",15 November 2021

lucaseduardoalcantara, Movie for children only,"As an adult, I think this movie is a complete mess.

I really can't understand. The film industry will not improve this way.",16 November 2021
prathamtripathi, Shang Chi review,"This film us well written and directed. All the action sequences are well choreographed. This is an origin story but it will not give you marvel movie vibe(in a positive way) until and unless you will see the post credit scenes. Yes, there are 2 credit scenes. Simu liu and Tony was the highlight of the movie, Awkwafina has also performed well. Her chemistry with Simu was extraordinary and her comic timing was also perfect.",6 September 2021
handaloo," It's not as bad as people are saying, it's also not quite as good.","First off, this is a decent movie.Sure, there's a buttload of tropey nonsense, small furry Disney creatures and all that, but overall it's a good MCU inclusion and Simu Liu is great, as are MOST of the other actors.The story is pretty decent, although a little over the place in parts, and does a pretty nice job of including it in the overall MCU as well as adding some nice Chinese mythical callbacks or whatever you would call them.The acting is excellent, especially Tony Leung who I would say is the most relatable antagonist since Marvel's Daredevil and the superb Kingpin.However, there's some pretty bad parts too. Awkwafina does well to not be quite as annoying as she's been in other parts, but is given WAY too much credit and screen time considering she's just Shang Chi's buddy and has no actual skill or reason to be there. Especially with how's she's treated by Wong later in the movie. Why Marvel needs her to be included quite as much I've no idea. Especially considering how great Shang Chi and his sister were in the film.Lastly, the fight choreography. It is VERY good. An absolute tribute to the late Brad Allan and was a joy to watch. Especially the close up work and the Chinese weaponry which was displayed super well.Overall, it's well worth a cinema visit. It's a good film and doesn't deserve all the 1 star reviews AT ALL.",4 September 2021

stefanozucchelli, Not a good movie,"This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist. I don't know if the movie is bad or I can't watch Marvel movies anymore but I didn't like anything about this movie, neither the story, nor the special effects, nor the acting. It all seemed too exaggerated and predictable, plus two hours is really too much for a movie of this type.The only interesting parts were the first minutes where you see the meeting between the parents and the clash between the abomination and the monk whose name I don't remember.I think instead the worst part was the final battle, even the too long and exaggerated one.",24 December 2021
klown013, A silly goofy boarderline cartoon,"This should be considered an animated film based on the amount of terrible cartoon like CGI utilized. From ""floppy"" animation used in place of human stunt people for MANY of the fight scenes (sorry, but martial arts are a lot less impressive when there are no actual people involved) to the terrible Avatar looking backgrounds and even cars / buses. For the amount of money put into a film like this I would hope the effects would be better than an episode of Game of Thrones, but instead they looked like the Matrix part 2. All of the actors involved were fantastic - when it was actually them, not a CGI stand in, but the story was all over the place, the villain(?) made no sense, I honestly have no idea what the hell was going on in the last half hour compared to the first hour. This movie was a mess all around, and compared to other MCU films feels like a total cluster-F. Definitely the worst movie I've seen this year, possibly in the last 10 years.",15 November 2021

Definitely a good movie to watch as it does what it is supposed to in that it is generally a setup film for something bigger in the MCU.Like many of the other Marvel Films in the MCU, they have to start somewhere. As an origin film it does it very well and perhaps the best origin / starting film for superhero movies that is full of action, decent story that is somewhat predictable (as it is for most origin stories) though generally fresh, fun and great characters.

adamsmith-51004," Calm down mate, I'm not dead it's just a performance","Another Marvel comics movie. This one takes one of their lesser known characters, martial artist Shang-chi. And gives him a film of his own.This is not a jumping on point to Marvel movies, as pre knowledge of some other ones will help.Shang-Chi lives in America. He has a past he thought he left behind. He enjoys karaoke with his best friend (Awkwafina) and he just lives. He has martial arts movie posters on his bedroom wall.But then his past catches up with him and he is forced to fight. Head across the world. Discover his past. And his destiny...Like the Black Panther film, this does a good job of showing this world outside of America. It's very stylish in representing it's culture and has some great art direction. It does manage to get a lot of exposition in without being overwhelmed by it, which is not something all comic book movies that have to do that manage.Awkwafina is quite entertaining playing a character who could easily be very annoying. The first action set piece is terrific, original gripping and really well done.And all in all, it does succeed by being a little bit different to what has come before.There is an entertaining surprise as well. Which succeeds in doing some good continuity.Minor quibbles: it's ten minutes too long. My attention did wander during some of the quieter moments and scenes of people talking. One flashback is a bit extraneous. The character of his sister ends up being rather underused.And outside of the first set piece I mentioned, they forgot to put any other bits of jeopardy in here. Of the other two set pieces, the first doesn't carry any because you don't believe people are going to get hurt. And the final big battle set piece is yet another of these. We've seen them all many times now, and even though this has some different elements, it's still too same old same old.But all in all an entertaining watch, and those who like their martial arts movies, or who like to pretend to do such things when watching fight scenes, will be entertained.Do as ever keep watching to the very end of the closing credits for a couple of extra scenes.",26 November 2021

rowanking-06598," Pretty great action, overall fun film to watch","Shang-Shi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is definitely pretty high up on my MCU list, a lot because of it's really well directed action sequences. In a lot of previous MCU fight scenes it can be kind of hard to even tell what is going on half the time. But in Shang-Shi, not only are some of the fight scenes really interesting like that one scene on the bus where we get that continuous shot of Shang-Shi moving up the bus through a bunch of people, or the scene where they're attacked on the side of the building and half to climb down this thing, jumping and swinging around it. Also, the movie looks AWESOME at some times, and it's kinda' like a light show. The special effects look great, and the movie is well directed, and fun to watch.Really the only problem I have with movie are just smaller, like the movie kinda' slows down toward the middle. There's also that scene toward the end of the movie, where we see him flashing back to his mom getting taken away, which seems kinda' useless and just to dramatize everything before we reach the big climax.But other than that, the movie is totally worth the watch and I highly recommend it.",21 November 2021

movieman6-413-929510," With Shang-Chi, Marvel presents their first Asian superhero in a good and cultural way.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting. Meng'er Zhang does not get that much time in the film, but a bit less good or present in the film.",2 September 2021
phollyjunk, Good but could have been great,"If it wasn't for the over use of the Marvel ""comedy"" that they always force into these movies and the terrible CGI, this could have been one of the best Marvel movies yet but Disney seems too stubborn to deviate from the generic formula they use for their movies.",21 November 2021

raptorclock, Long but enjoyable,"I'm not a fan of Marvel movies. Not because I don't like them, but more simply because I never had enough time to see them all, thus losing all the connections between the various plots.Fortunately, this film also seems to work on its own, except for a few passages that deserve some more knowledge.Of course, like the films of the universe it is a part of, this film is all too perfect. There isn't a smudge and not even the secondary characters never even look disheveled.It will seem counterintuitive, but personally when you see something so neat, I lose interest because it will seem too fake.Even some dialogue, especially at the beginning of the film, seems so stupid that it sounds irritating.That said, the film still works, entertains and has its right emotional charge to make you follow the film to the end without ever getting bored.The characters are interesting and it's easy to get attached to them. Like all Marvel movies, I guess we'll see them again soon, and this movie was a nice way to introduce them to us. Ultimately, a movie that you will enjoy even if you are not a huge Marvel fan.",18 November 2021
edwin-wks, Super-Tokenism,"As a Chinese person living in Australia, watching Shang Chi was an uncomfortable experience. Not unexpectedly, they resorted to the tired tropes of king fu/martial arts and Eastern mysticism as if that is all Chinese culture is about. Unlike Black Panther, where they envisioned a futuristic African kingdom, Shang Chi would not be out of place in 15th-century China. It is exasperatingly unimaginative and reductive. If they were to apply the same treatment to the white heroes of the Marvel universe, we would be watching either a Western or a bunch of heroes/villains who are supremely adept at colonizing new territories, subjugating their local populace and stealing their wealth. Instead of the diversity and inclusivity that they might have intended, this feels more like opportunism/tokenism disguised as benevolence. Disney, do better.",31 October 2021
neil-476, Very enjoyable,"Shang-Chi leaves San Francisco with his friend Katy in pursuit of old family secrets and discovers crime, danger, previously unknown family, quite a lot of wire-fu, ancient myths, and a couple of faces familiar to those who follow the MCU.This is the first MCU movie where I have been completely unfamiliar with the source material and, therefore not sure what to expect other than martial arts.well, I've seen a fair number of martial arts movies (without seeking them out), so the building blocks for Shang-Chi are not unfamiliar.But they are very engagingly assembled. The story is strong, with moral ambivalence playing a part. The action is extremely well choreographed and, at times - and in common with the settings and costumes - quite beautiful. This is a gorgeous film to watch. The effects are, as expected, first rate.The script is good, with much more laughter than I expected. It is helped here by Awkwafina - playing her typical raucous character she adds a welcome note of humorous disrespect, yet she also acts well and is sympathetically in tune with the plot and characters. Michelle Yeoh is stable and relatable. The leading character is, arguably, a little light on charisma, but this is not necessarily a bad thing given that one of the main plot threads is about Shang-Chi finding himself.",8 September 2021
azcdk, Horrible,"Just an 80's kung-fu flick jazzed up for 2021. More reminders of the 'horrible racism"" that exists, because America is the only Country that's had a problem with that...herp derp.",9 September 2021
RvBreukie, A very big Meh while it could have been soooo much more,"For starters, the cinematography and the CGI are pretty nice. However that's where the positive ends.The fighting choreography is ok, not bad but not great at all. For example even Mortal Combat did it way better with way less. Also it follows the usual marvel formula of a lot of CGI in the fighting scenes, but this time they blew of the roof with it making those scenes feel completely detached from the world they're in.Concerning the characters, Shang-Chi isn't really there for most parts of the movie, taking a few steps back in his very own movie. A lot of things that other characters did in their time in the spotlight should have been done by him, there was no reason for him to not do those things. Causing him to be a neglected in his own movie, basically a background character. As for the female leads, one is just plain annoying and really serves no purpose(you'll know instantly when she appears). The other is an over-the-top strong woman actually getting most of the screentime, which don't get me wrong the actress acts nicely, but the way she is presented in the story and the way her character has come to be and is established is just unnatural and feels like she's just someone who has activated IRL-cheats, it just feels like they took a real shortcut with her character whilst there was so much they could've done to make her really likeable and immersable for you as a viewer. However the way they handled her just makes her feel like a 2D cardboard character that used cheats to max her stats.As for the story and dialogue. The story is just abyssmal, really lacking in content and feels like something a hungover student would drum up last-minute after a late night party. The dialogue feels wooden most of the time, just really unnatural and don't even get me started on the ""humor"" which is overly forced and just really bad.It feels like a movie that knows what it wants to do, but not how it wants to do that and just goes at it in a dozen ways leaving to much clutter and sidesteps for it to feel like a coherent story. If only they had chosen 1 or 2 things and stuck with them it could have been a decent flick.",5 September 2021
kevinleenorwood, Marvel's Movie Quality is Changing to Nothing More Than A Message Board,"Overall, the movie was worth a watch. A lot of pretty scenery and great fight scenes. It is just getting ridiculous how the directors and production companies are not caring about the movie quality anymore, as long as they get their messages out. You can tell the director and writer have never picked up a Marvel Comic. They way they try to make you see that this movie is tied into the Marvel Universe is ludicrous. I see the writers all sitting around someone who got themselves in the group because daddy works at a higher level. No experience whatsoever.""Let's see, I have an idea. Ok hear me out. Wong, Wong is Asian so lets make sure he makes an appearance. That makes great sense to me. Now what reason would Wong have to fight in a place you wouldn't find anyone as honorable as he is, to be hanging out. Ok, let's don't explain that people will just get it because he is Asian, right? Ok now who would he fight in the ""Look here I am to connect this movie to us"" scene? Oh, I got it. Abomination. Ya that makes total sense to me. I mean, Wong was just minding his business one day, and Abomination stopped by because he was in the area and wanted to know if he wanted to go fishing. Wong said sure, let me open up a portal to the lake and we will go. Oh, my. My portal got messed up. How did we get to an illegal fight club in China? Ok, I guess while we are here, we will sign up to fight each other, since I just forgot how to open my portals. (Oh No!) Fight, Fight, Fight. Ok Abomination I am going to make you punch yourself. Hands through the portal, my favorite trick. Works all of the time. Ouch, Wong. That hurt. Oh but guess what Abomination. When you took that hit, it woke me up to remember how to open my portals again. Let's go home, shall we. Ok Wong, let's go.That is it. It would rival the greats. I am a genius.No you are an idiot. Actually, you may just have bad taste. The hiring people at Marvel are idiots and the people that give final approval, are no better.Well, we had a good first round of Marvel movies for 20 years. The millennium generation is taking over, so it is all downhill from here. Dang.",11 September 2021

ObsessiveCinemaDisorder," Loved the first half more, watch it for Tony Leung's villain","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining albeit formulaic popcorn Marvel film that's part-family drama and part-kung fu adventure that is raised by Tony Leung's villainous performance as Wenwu. It delivers a solid introduction to an Asian American superhero while paying tribute to Chinese martial arts films.First off, it's very pleasing to see the warm reception Shang-Chi has received across the world. It's a phenomenon to see English-speaking audiences intensely cheering for a subtitled film that has large portions in Mandarin. Back in my university days, the average Western filmgoer typically would not see a foreign subtitled movie on the account of not wanting ""to read a movie."" Look at how much the world has changed now.The first half of Shang-Chi plays much stronger. The San Francisco bus sequence is reminiscent of a Hollywood big-budgeted version of 90's Jackie Chan films set in Western locales, like Rumble in the Bronx, Who Am I or First Strike.The fight choreography moves from hard fisticuffs towards fantastical wuxia, and plunges into more and more CGI. The former is more engaging with Shang-Chi being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time in a real setting.Simu Liu does a solid job as Shang-Chi and has impressive moves. Like an athlete, he sells the hits and moves swiftly when performing parkour. Liu grew on me throughout the movie, much to the aid of the always-charismatic Awkwafina as his best friend Katy. They share a charming banter as if they were doubling as their own R2-D2 and C-3PO.The film's MVP is Tony Leung, who approaches his role with an award-worthy intensity, injecting a depth and gravitas to his villain that elevates the film to another level.I was amazed by the depth Leung achieved through his scenes. The scene that struck me was a flashback where Tony Leung's Wenwu comes home through his door and gives a look of concern to his own family. In that one glance, Leung portrays a completely different person in contrast to the villain in the present. His performance cut right through me and I felt I was watching someone suffer.It is unfortunate as Wenwu is undercut by the script introducing a second villain late in the second half, which diminishes Leung's character. Wenwu is established as an immortal who's fought for power through the ages, yet there's a lack of wisdom in his latter actions that felt unconvincing.Shang-Chi's third act takes a strange turn into mythic realms and loses the gravitas that was promised in the first act. The story shifts into a westerner's stereotypical view of China. We get the straw hats, the rice paddy village that looks Cambodian, and the constant mention of dragons. With a CGI-infused finale spectacle, the movie then exhausts all the good will earned from the first half.Shang-Chi is entertaining Marvel fare that will be remembered best as a cultural zeitgeist icon for Asian American representation. However, as a film, I don't feel the need to revisit it anytime soon. When I will, it will be for the San Francisco section and Tony Leung scenes.I am Asian, not Asian American. I'm happy for other Asian Americans who feel represented by Shang-Chi. I personally do not feel that representation from this film and am fine with that. Looking at the film itself, I admit Shang-Chi is one great step in the Asian American representation fight. However, it's apparent there's still a heck of a long way to go...",30 September 2021

Engerek01, It's ok,"In simple words, this movie is full of stereotypes buffed with overuse of CGI. In other words, this is more a Disney movie than a Marvel.Plot is as simple as it gets. If you had watched the trailer, from the 1st moments of the movie, you'll know exactly what will happen and in what order. At that point, Marvel usually throws in a few surprises. Not in this one. Everything goes smoothly from an action fantasy children movie.Acting is great. Everyone plays their roles to perfection. There's nothing to complain here.CGI is, like I said earlier, more Disney than Marvel. Remember the Lion King remake where it didn't feel right. It's the same here. Looks gorgeous at first sight but fails to connect emotionally.In Summary, there are entertaining moments, but the writers room clearly saved the good stuff for future movies.

chris_rowe-881-168820, Nothing original,"It feels like a mash up of about 10 old movies anc 20 plots weaved into one film, for me I didn't enjoy it very much, there were positives but overall I didn't leave feeling like I'd seen something that special. It didn't feel like a marvel film, I'm not against diversity or going in different directions but it just wasn't a film I loved or would see again. The characters were bland and uninspiring, the humour was ok but bit same old same old and the plot which I'd guess you'd call the main theme felt a bit daft.The cgi was awesome, graphics, choreography and costumes all really nice, parts were genuinely beautiful but if the film ain't doing much for me that doesn't matter.Think a lot would hinge on whether you got this gimmick or liked it, I didn't, they were cool for set pieces and what they wanted to achieve in the movie but I just felt they weren't something I thought was interesting or that impressive.It was always going one way, it was pretty predictable and I didn't feel or believe the emotion as I found the story a bit stupid, it just felt directionless and they were trying to do so much whilst achieving very little.It felt long to, much longer than the run time, it just wasn't a film I'd recommend and it was one I felt disappointed.I maybe backwards though as everyone's saying this makes up for black widow, I don't get that, I thought black widow was brilliant. Way better than this.Also it seems if it's Asian and a bit funny everyone calls awkwafina.",9 September 2021
minge-79873, A fresh entry to the MCU!,"After being disappointed by Black Widows' solo outing and not knowing anything about a minor comics character I feared for Shang-Chi. But I was not disappointed.Straight off and you get a cultured vibe honouring Asian film and tradition and you get superb action and charismatic characters all well delivered by a strong cast.Reminding me of Jackie Chan in his heyday, the martial arts is fast and creative. Shang-chi feels really grounded and fresh for the first half of the film and it's good to move away from too much wild. But then the second half blends Asian folklore and Marvel fantasy to truly deliver a spectacle. Without having to explain itself too deeply the consistent nods to Dr Strange remind you that other dimensions exist and people can bend powers in believable ways.Whilst it may not have needed to go so far onto fantasy, any true Marvel fan knows this is just another tuesday. The performances are strongly delivered and Shang-Chi is likely to become a new fan favourite.",3 September 2021

Too far fetched for me to enjoy and I just didn't enjoy the story.The headless creature and scouse guy were interesting additions. It is watchable if you're not expecting much.Overall, I wouldn't recommend unless you love extremely far fetched non fiction superhero movies.",4 April 2022
saikatsamanta, People are going a tad bit Crazy with the Praise !!!,"First of all, I think People are overhyping this film a bit like they did Black Panther. Is this the Best MCU Origin Film Ever ?? Hell No !! There are atleast 3 better origin stories existing. But there's a lot of good things Shang-Chi does that differentiates this film from the normal MCU film. The Visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any MCU film I have seen. The tone of the film resembles Chinese Action Movies more rather than MCU which is so refreshing. The first few fight scenes are just incredible and got me super hyped but the quality falls in the later scenes when it becomes a CGI Monsterfest. The story is very predictable and full of narration and exposition. At its core its a very emotional family drama but the dialogues are not powerful enough to dig really deep and I craved for that in so many scenes. The performances are solid with Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley providing great Comedic Relief, but the standout is Tony Leung. He generates such level of empathy and emotional suffering with just his eyes, He is the Legend after all. Overall its a really fun watch, but not as great as people are shouting it is.",15 September 2021
hariharanash, Yet another Superhero flick focused more on visuals and (forced) comedy,"Shang-Chi has a promising start with stunning locations with a nice martial-arts-movie feel. The fights were nice. Of course we have some good cracks along the way. Later on, we get into the main story line and that's where it starts to fall off. The jokes start to make you wonder why they are kind of forced into the picture because some of them are very lame. Comedy worked good in Thor: Ragnarok, I really loved them. But here its just bad. That's all.The main problem with the story is that *spoilers alert* Shang Chi and the villagers could have easily made his father understand about the whole soul-eaters thing. That guy seems to have lived more than 1000 years and wouldn't he understand about the whole talking to the mind thing?One last annoying thing is that why the hell they are having two post credits scene as if they were any good. The last one never needed to be in the post credits at all. That's just a normal scene which could have been shown before the credits.Shang-Chi would may be entertaining for those who are new to the whole superhero movies. For others, it may seem very formulaic, doing the same thing with different (weak) stories.",17 September 2021

mikate, Short - changed,Usual kung fu fantasy action ... all been done before as has the story line ... boring waste of money and time. This constant response working of the same story lines using the same themes show that commercial film making is in a very narrow cul de sac ..,13 October 2021
locutas, Mediocre at best,"Just flat and somewhat boring, felt more like a DC TV show then a Marvel film.Entertaining but just falls down as a Marvel film so many hero's in the Marvel universe why pick this one?!",10 November 2021
adamthorn-31294, Amazing,Shang-Chi was honestly amazing. The cinematic experience was great and the story and plot of the movie was very good too. I am a huge marvel fan and it makes me happy to see that they are branching out to different types of hero's from all types of backgrounds. To sum up my review I really enjoyed it and highly recommend. (stay for the credits to the end),5 September 2021
benibkill, Kung Fu Panda in the MCU?,"This movie is one of the best in the MCU. The story, the characters, the comedy, and especially the action was exceptional. The choreography was stunning and fresh. The characters are relatable and understandable. The Mandarin is one of the best villains in the entire MCU. The mythological aspect was a nice addition to the film, which I personally liked quite a bit. It had everything a superhero film needs. Overall, not too much to complain.",8 February 2022
sagniknath, Generic marvel movie that could have delivered so much more,"This had so much potential that got sadly wasted.The few fight scenes in the first half were better in quality compared to the usual Marvel quick cut edited ones. They were mildly reminiscent of the Matrix fights( The intro to the Shangchi theme music even sounded suspiciously similar to Furious Angels from Matrix Reloaded and made me miss the Matrix films more)However, anything positive about the film ends in the first half only with the second half culminating in a bloated CGI mess that is the hallmark of almost all Marvel movies. In fact, between Shangchi and Black Widow, I'd say the latter featured much better visual effects which would have looked better on the big screen than this. Shangchi would have been a more apt as a direct to video release.)It didn't also help that the lead actor was a complete void of charisma.Honestly, I am just going to watch some Jackie Chan movies now to now to help deal with the kung fu cravings this movie initiated in me but failed to deliver.",4 September 2021
marc5477, Kung Fu Romp with Lame Story,"Its your typical high flying kung fu action script layered on top of an uninteresting story with no depth.The main character and his sidekick were tiring to watch because they are adults acting like teens. They never managed to become interesting. The acting however was fine so its not a knock on the actors themselves but the script was kiddie. They were clearly going for the teen demographic with this movie.I personally couldnt enjoy it. Marvel in general, hasnt really produced a film that I enjoyed in a very long time so its not really surprising. This might be fun if you are younger but for adults who have seen or read a lot of stories, this is probably not good.",15 November 2021
gadfeal, Expensively produced but unoriginal modern Martial Arts film,"6 for purely martial arts entertainment.There are dozens of China-produced/financed martial arts/fantasy films where Laws of Physics-agnostic fight scenes are as implausible as the speeded up movements. However, most are either based on some ancient fable or setting, or in a police/crime drama where Chinese cities appear more modern than anything in North America.Probably also financed by China-based interests, this is a Disneyfied take on the bread-and-butter of Chinese martial arts films. The plot to draw in US audiences is to have the two young protagonists played by 1st generation N. Americans, including the off-the-wall Akwafina with her mouthy repartees and gravely vocal delivery.Apart from that, it is not particularly distinctive, with the major ""star"" casting of Michelle Yeoh who is well-known to US audiences for decades, first as a Bond ""girl"", then in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Star Trek Discovery series, and in Filthy Rich Asians. As a Malaysian, she is illiterate in any Chinese language, and learns her lines phonetically!The lead, an unknown Canadian, is competent and Awkwafina does her part to make the film ""relatable"" to the social media generation. Good CGI and opulent sets don't compensate for an otherwise ""run of the mill"" martial arts production.------------------5/10 Social significance for US audiences.As for social comment, it is high time that entertainment media fully represent the demographic reality of the US, where 6 percent of Americans are of Asian origin, but both actors and storylines are almost invisible, only as secondary characters to a White or Jewish protagonist if they are Asian-American, or only able to seek pigeonholing roles of an immigrant, shopkeeper, criminal gangster, or taciturn Eastern guru - all of whom speak English with a demented cookie voice.This movie does nothing to address the basic lack of visible integration of Asian Americans into the fabric of portrayals of TV or film. I can think only of 911, and of the former reboot of Charlie's Angels where the Asian origin of characters was neither highlighted nor subjugated.Apart from that, the multiplication of Mono-ethnocentric productions (on ""Black"" cable networks) still does not address the lack of portrayal of non-Whites in an integrated fashion - but a form of Apartheid in mass media.",22 October 2021

rmirchandani, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings already became one of my favourite MCU flicks,"The latest Marvel film ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" directed by Destin Daniel Cretton is fast paced, action packed and visually stunning masterpiece, that proves that Marvel is stronger than ever. The fight choreography loosely inspired by Jackie Chan's and other Asian martial arts films was insane and jaw dropping. Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel, Bruce Banner aka the Hulk and Doctor Strange's right hand man Wong made cameo appearances in the mid-credits scene. Wong appeared twice in the film, while Bruce and Carol only appeared in the mid-credits scene.Final verdict: 10/10.",5 December 2021

Didn't know what to expect in this movie. Then later on, the casts started speaking English & the awesome fighting scenes kicked in. OMG!! How exciting~ The fighting choreography was unbelievable. Just as good as Jackie Chan movies!The storyline was alright but the CG was very good. They used lots of Chinese culture tradition, costume & symbols. Looking forward to see the next sequel.",3 September 2021
virpatwardhan, Shang - Chi Movie Review,"Marvel Studios has gained a glamorous reputation throughout the last decade, and this film was a huge milestone for superhero cinema, Asian representation, and the studio as a whole. Like Black Panther was to a lot of African-American audiences, Shang-Chi will ignite a spark in the hearts of Asians. This film opens the door to a relatable character and I love Simu-Liu's portrayal of Shang-Chi. I have watched Simu previously in the show Kim's Convenience as a comedic character and there couldn't have been better casting for Shang-Chi. Simu reflects the combination of an Asian-American character superbly and has an amazing screen presence. His character reminded me of Captain America because of his leadership role in the film, standing up against all odds, and overall amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast. Awkwafina's character, Katie, was an amazing character, filled with comedic relief that gave a lighter tone, to a film that was a little bit too dark for a Marvel film. Tony Leung's character, The Mandarin stole the show with a vengeance. Tony Leung is absolutely ground-breaking in every role he plays and The Mandarin was a unique role he took on. Leung had an amazing screen presence and was my character in the film. The visual effects in the film were unique and I could see that the animators had taken inspiration from traditional Chinese films regarding Martial Arts, also having similarities in design to Doctor Strange. The action in this film was mind-blowing like I was expecting, and I loved the fight on the bus. The soundtrack was average, with the usage of traditional Chinese instruments. The songs used in the film were composed by primarily Chinese Hip-Hop artists and I enjoyed them. The writing in this film was good, but not great. One of the criticisms I have about the film is that the plot did not feel original and could've been executed far better. There were a lot of parts in the middle of the film that stole away from the central plot of the film. This film had a more emphasis on magic and fantasy as suppose Kung Fu. Overall, this film is hands down one of the best gems Marvel has produced, and I cannot wait for Shang-Chi to integrate with the Marvel Cinematic Universe further.",6 September 2021
FeastMode, My eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it.WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as I walked to the car. It's been a while since I walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like Civil War and Winter Soldier. And for the most part, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).The fight scenes in this movie.... how do I describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 5 seconds like I've noticed in the MCU.This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. It has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that I was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. They're all amazing.Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. The villain has full depth with clear motivations you can sympathize with. Cool, charismatic, intimidating, and formidable. Everything you want in a villain.Another area of improvement is the musical scores. Most of them don't stand out. I think they learned. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. And now this. Not only is it a great score, it fits perfectly in the movie and the individual scenes/moments. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but it definitely elevated the movie. It feels unique to this new franchise.Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. Flashbacks can slow down a movie, but here they are some of the best scenes.I loved all the characters, I loved all the casting choices, I loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. It fires on all cylinders.Lmao I didn't mention the cinematography. Why would I wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters. It feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that I didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.Continuing what I said in my headline, I have this thing where I get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. I don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other people. Maybe it's partly because I can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like, ""this is the coolest thing I've ever seen in my life."" Hyperbole, but mannnnn.After Endgame (basically) finished phase 3, I was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But I wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew I would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But I wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow.All in all, I adore this movie. You may wonder why I wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and I watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, Inception, Mad Max Fury Road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. The only superhero movies I've given 10s are The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises and Civil War.If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but I might not be able to! (4 viewings, opening Thursday 9/2/2021, 9/5/2021, 9/22/2021, 3/26/2022)",3 September 2021
JurijFedorov," The Chinese art and mythology is great, the plot is bareboned and tame","It's good, but not great.Disney was trying to market this as an Asian American flick made by and for Asian Americans. Which really never bodes well. When a movie caters to a specific race like this it's usually produced not directed. It usually just uses cheap race pointed gimmicks and tropes. But the reviews for this movie have been really good. So I didn't quite know what to expect. After Endgame and Black Widow and I really thought Marvel had lost it. Black Panther was just okay. This surpasses all the 3 movies and returns Marvel to a greater level again. It does remind me of Captain Marvel, not nearly as good, but similar quality and structure to it with similar problems.We have a male lead, Shang. A dry actor who lacks the charisma needed for the role, but he is just fine. Then he has a female friend who is the star of the show when she is on screen with him. She is just funny and cute. Her humor is a bit forced and weird here, but she knows humor and makes it work. There are some scenes where it's too much though. Shang then has a sister who yet again is more charming than him, but not by much. She has that extra bit of charisma with a cool hair style while Shang is a handsome, happy, satisfied young person. There is no personal suffering or emotions behind his eyes. He acts out scenes and moves on. It's not a deep character like Batman. Rather this is the old comic book Superman. Just a force with no pain. He beats up people and moves on.The dad is amazing! He basically makes the movie. He totally steals his scenes and his acting is spotless. You really have to see him to understand just what he delivers on screen as the antagonist. Even the Romanian with one hand is way better on screen than the protagonist. Basically everyone else has more charisma than the lead.The main issue here is the lack of clear plot focus of a good guy fighting evil. The dad tries to rescue an evil force he thinks is his dead wife. So he sends assassins after his son to get an amulet from him and to call him back. Same with his daughter. So the first hour of the movie is just fight after fight where the protagonist barely survives until we learn that the assassins are actually just there to greet them. So all of that was for nothing? Yep, no one was supposed to die. The dad just wanted to contact his kids. So where is the bad guy even?The fights are cool enough, but we don't understand why they happen and when we learn why they happened it's a huge letdown. The choreography and CGI is good though. The Chinese mythology here is amazing. There are a lot of real myth animals and old Chinese art. They even speak Chinese for much of the movie which is extra great. It just works to make it feel rich and interesting. It's all true to real myths and real national history. Things Communist China once tried to burn and destroy to replace it with a new system. So they are recreating a lost world and culture in CGI. Unfortunately the ""bad guy"" never appears. The dad is sorta, kinda bad at times. The son fights his dad without magic while the dad is using magic. Yet they are equally powerful. So it's not clear what there is at stake? It's clear that the good guys can beat up even magical beings with their skills alone. Once they get magical power and extra weapons it's too easy. You don't feel like it's finally fair. You feel like it was already too easy and now it's extremely easy. At one point the evil forces are released by the dad, but even that fight is very one-sided. It's too many good guys and they are way too powerful. The dad is a powerful character, but he never really feels dangerous.This reminds me of Captain Marvel and Captain Marvel in Endgame. Or the modern Spiderman with a billion electronic tools to save his ass all the time. It's just not fun to see a protagonist trained as a killer easily kill everyone. There is nothing at play, no one loses anything, nothing is really in any danger. You need a weak character fighting greater forces. A character who has an inner need to prove himself. The movie lacks thematic soul. While the mythology and Chinese art give it another type of artistic soul. It's just not enough to really make it work. It needed both things. So while it totally rests on one element and works as a fun watch it still feels empty overall. I want to rewatch Captain Marvel. It's at least fun and has some clear plot and deep characters even though Captain Marvel is never in danger of losing. Here there is less personality and fewer grounded characters as everything is magical. It's a wish-fulfillment movie all the way. We don't even see people getting hurt as all that is off screen. So characters are killed without us seeing the actual death. It's all very, very tame to a level Marvel has never done before. A proper Disney movie. I totally would get it if some people wouldn't like the movie. Same with Black Panther. It feels too simple and shallow. But this is 10 times better than Black Widow and other such huge duds. I still have no want to watch a sequel. Shang will just be even stronger... what's the point? I don't want to watch another Captain Marvel movie either as such unless they do something really creative. Or Black Panther. You need to tone down their powers. But this one is fully dead in the water as it just feels shallow all the way. At least we got the magical world, but I have already seen it. So I don't want to see it again. I want to experience a plot and feel the struggle. Without a struggle there is nothing deeper to explore. But at least Marvel shows that they still care about CGI so there is always something to enjoy in these movies.",6 December 2021
ryancdog, What a stinker!,Wow what a stinker! Who wanted this movie made? Who are they that this movie was made for? Clearly NOT China as they won't allow it to be shown in their country. Just another boring MCU movie. Probably was worth more than a 1 star but all those 9 and 10 star ratings are undeserved. I'd recommend waiting till this is free on your Disney+ subscription without paying their ridiculous mark up of $30. It's worth waiting for! Definitely NOT worth going to the theater and paying your hard earned money to see it.,4 September 2021
IronManu77, A big thumbs down,"There is no story here, just mindless martial arts gelled with computer graphics, and the movie has some scenes that reminded me of Avatar. Anyhow, Avatar was great, this is not. It is one of the worst Marvel movies. I can go back to rewatching Thor Ragnorok or Endgame and still enjoy them, but not this one.",27 November 2021
The-Sarkologist, Marvel Goes Full Kung-Fu,"I was somewhat surprised that the ten rings came back. I knew that they existed, and had been villains in a past MCU film, but a part of me wasn't expecting to see them again, that is until I saw the title of this film. Mind you, a part of me suspected that the Ten Rings were more of an Iron Man villain, but in the end I'm certainly not all that much of a fan of comics books, and I have certainly never really managed to get into them. Sure, I have purchased a couple over the years, but honestly, they have never really impressed me, at least the superhero comics, which seem to pretty much dominate most comic book stores these days.The thing with Shang-Chi is that it comes across a lot of a well made Hong Kong action flick, which I suspect was the intention. It is in part Big Trouble in Little China (which is probably why a part of the film was set in San Francisco, but also probably because San Francisco has a pretty large Chinatown). In another sense this film was much better produced than the old Hong Kong films, and as such reminded me more of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I suspect that this was done on purpose, namely so that it simply doesn't become just another Superhero film, and in that regards Shang-Chi certainly does play quite well into that.So, the story centres around this guy who discovers ten rings, an item that gives him immense power, and also immortality. Thus he builds up and army called The Army of the Ten Rings, and pretty much conquers the world. However, he hears of another realm full of mythical animals and decides to go and find it, but gets into a fight with the guardian. During the fight they fall in love and have children, however she is killed, and after he trains up his son up as a warrior, he orders his son to kill the head of the Iron Gang, but his son refuses and flees to the United States to work at a fancy hotel.This is basically an origin story, but much of it has to do with him fighting his father, who is the true Mandarin (if you remember from Iron Man 3, there was this guy known as the Mandarin, but it was just an actor that was acting as a cover for somebody else, and it then turns out that that particular Mandarin wasn't the true one as well). As for the army of the ten rings, they appeared in Iron Man I, being the group that kidnapped Tony Stark to get him to build them some weapon systems, but other than being a terrorist organisation, they didn't play all that prominently in the films after that.I'm a little loath to simply say that this is just another superhero film, because as I previously mentioned, there is a lot of the kung-fu film feel to it as well. However, I guess the problem is that we are probably reaching the point where there is starting to be quite a bit of Superhero fatigue. Then again, there has been a number of films released this year that had been put on hold due to the pandemic. However, I did find that this film was still quite fun, and while it sort of runs alongside your typical Marvel script, there is enough in this film to actually make it somewhat different. It was okay, just not particularly great. Oh, I should mention that there were some nice lines in it nonetheless.",29 November 2021

Sancler, Another ruined opportunity.,"The whole thing is like a BMW commercial, shot in Narnia with a few urban dancing (pardon me, ''kungfu'') elements. The rest of the time it's just boring you to death. With an incredibly annoying cast (e.g. The goofy sidekick cliché) with typical lame one-liners that aren't even close to funny. A predictable plot, full of reprehensible contemporary vlogger content. However good the choreography might be, if it's the only thing that stands out, it's simply a bad movie.Also, this overhyped soundtrack is absolutely nothing special. Terrible even. Just some famous poppy tunes varied with some derivative oriental sounds.Too bad Marvel seems to be truly unable to create anything for somewhat more intelligent adults.Oh, and for the wokers among us...

nightringer-76840, Big Budgeted Wu Xia 101,"I'm honestly conflicted rating this film. On one side, Disney introduced Chinese culture and myths to the world; on another side, this is like watching amateur 70s wu xia (check wikipedia) in Disney's gigantic budget, which means bad story - big action - expensive special effects - expensive experienced supporting actors - new comer hero. The result is still a bad big budget movie that solely rely on ""Marvel"" brand and Disney's money to conquer China's box office.The story is poorly written and not even try to be more creative. I would prefer to see this as a 6 to 10 1-hour limited TV series to further develop the characters. As it is, the burden went to Tony Leung too much without even giving his character room to grow. So yes, I agree this was Disney and Marvel 1st co-experimental film together (Disney's first was Mulan which at least a little better.Looks like MCU is currently a money mining exploitation using Marvel brand and Disney.",25 November 2021
thomasrippon, Amazing.,An iconic film with excellent combat.Perfect new start.,18 September 2021
cifers," Marvel ruins the Mandarin again (and Shang-Chi, too)","**Spoilers for Shang-Chi and Iron Man 3**The Mandarin is one of Marvels most iconic vilains. He is the arch enemy of Iron Man, like Joker is the arch enemy of Batman. In Iron Man 3, they made a total joke of the Mandarin. A fine actor, Ben Kingsley, was wasted for a bad caricature of Mandarin.The Shang-Chi movie ruins the Mandarin again. Because this movie was made by left-wing liberals who preach political correctness. Because they wanted to avoid anything which might be offensive or racist. Let me ask you, what is racist about an Asian man wearing traditional Asian clothes? And what is racist about an Asian man with long hair and beard? Exactly, absolutely nothing. That's how the Mandarin looks like in the comicbooks. In this movie, he has short hair, Western everyday clothes, looking like a random regular guy (boring), totally different name. Also, in the comicbooks, each of his rings has its own power, that means ten different powers. In this movie, all rings have the same power, so not even that is done right. In conclusion, this Mandarin has nothing to do with the original.By the way, this movie ruins Shang-Chi, too. He gets god-like powers, he could defeat the mighty Thor. Why??? Shang-Chi is a tribute to Bruce Lee, he doesn't have superpowers, martial arts is his skill. Why not making great martial arts movies with Shang-Chi instead of CGI superpower blockbuster stuff?People who gave high ratings for this movie don't know the source material, so they cannot judge.",7 September 2021

marcusman48, Effectively nothing new,"SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is being called ""the Asian BLACK PANTHER,"" and I think this is an inaccurate description for two reasons. First, Asian cultures have been explored in-depth by Hollywood since the 1970s at the latest, and in ways that sub-Saharan African cultures have not. But second, and more to the point, SHANG-CHI is really just a mashup of two Hollywood subgenres that have been around for quite some time: the ""ethnic discovery"" film and the ""stupid American tourist"" film.The ""ethnic discovery"" film is the more recent type and by far the more interesting, ultimately inspired by Alex Haley's famous TV miniseries ""Roots."" It documents the saga of a protagonist who learns - or relearns - about his or her heritage and embarks on a quest to fully embrace that heritage. A good example I can think of is THUNDERHEART, in which an FBI agent (Val Kilmer) comes to appreciate his father's Native American ancestry while on a case on a Lakota reservation; a more famous but fantasy-based example is STAR WARS, in which Luke Skywalker learns that he has Jedi blood. On the surface, SHANG-CHI definitely follows this pattern.Unfortunately, the movie's ""ethnic discovery"" theme is undercut by the clichés of an even older Hollywood storyline: what one film historian has dubbed the ""racial adventure film,"" but which I simply call the ""stupid American tourist film."" Common since the 1930s, this film plot follows Western (and almost always white) characters as they visit an ""exotic"" foreign land - often for purely exploitative purposes - and proceed to reveal their ignorance about the ""native"" culture. It has always been demeaning to both the ""colonizing"" and indigenous peoples, since the former are forced to make buffoons of themselves and the latter must bear the humiliation of not being taken seriously.SHANG-CHI is an ""ethnic rediscovery"" film in that two Chinese-Americans from San Francisco learn (and, in one case, relearn) about the culture of their ancestors; but it is also a racial adventure film in that they are essentially Westerners who travel to China and find themselves in the midst of a culture clash. While not white - and, in the case of the titular character, an immigrant - Shang-Chi and his girlfriend otherwise fit the role of the ""stupid American tourist"" with their unmistakably American accents, annoying use of slang, pointless pop-culture references, and wisecracking sarcasm. The twist here is that, like Kilmer in THUNDERHEART, they revert to their ""noble savage"" origins once they have traveled to an ""ethnic"" place and ""gone native.""Not incidentally, there's one more way in which SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS differs dramatically from BLACK PANTHER. While both are based on ""non-Western"" comic book sagas created by white men, BLACK PANTHER turns stereotypes about black Africans completely inside-out, giving us fantastic science fiction instead of hackneyed ""jungle"" adventure. But SHANG-CHI is just the usual ""kung pow"" hash about the Orient, presented ironically but also in a way that isn't terribly original.In fact, if there's another Marvel movie this one closely resembles, it's not BLACK PANTHER but DEADPOOL. Both combine wacky humor and serious (and even ""dark"") subject matter in a way that's very jarring and ultimately exasperating. But at least DEADPOOL felt fresh.",23 September 2021

taz1004, Very weak story and character,"I thought this was Legend of the Ten Rings but doesn't tell anything about the rings.A lot of cliche and not-so funny moments but those will depend on viewer. What I'm unhappy about is the character development. I do not understand why Shang Chi is so upset at his father. I actually sympathize with the father. Shouldn't Shang Chi feel guilty for doing nothing and just watch his mom die rather than blame his father? And even after he knew his father was being used by the creatures in the dark, he says he'll kill his father???Some good action sequence were also negated by bad dragon CG.",13 November 2021
crowdaddi, Shang-Chi and the extremely annoying sidekick/friend katy,That Katy girl was freaking horrible and jokes were awful af. She ruins every scene she is in with some of the worst acting ever witnessed. Every scene she is either telling a joke that falls flat as hell or has a exaggerated gaping mouth stare while no one else looks surprised.Then after all that she shoots a moving dragon in the throat with an arrow from like a mile away with like two days of training to save the day. OMG!The rest of the movie was fine i guess. Kung-fu and dragons baby!,11 November 2021
GD_Marq, Great visuals and fight scenes,"I really liked the movie. The fight scenes were great and CGI was excellent. My only confusion was why some characters were so shocked that there were mystical creatures and the story that Shawn and Katie was telling their friends was so unbelievable to them especially since the timeline of this movie takes place after End Game. Did they not see aliens come down with crazy abilities? I think once this happens, someone has to believe that anything is possible.",4 September 2021
sj7075-292-151006," Boring, recycled, charmless, by order propaganda","Have you watched a Marvel action superhero movie before?What if you've watched, ALL the Marvel superhero movies?Then you're in for some HOT garbage in this movie, as this was made to order, copying EVERY scene from other Marvel movies.I mean every fight scene just felt like I'd watched it before, except now the characters doing them I had even less connection with. I'm bored with fights on buses and trains and people leaping around scaffolding. Every Marvel movie has a fight scene on a bus or a train, but this one felt REALLY recycled.Getting back round to the characters, besides Shang Chi, I can't remember his sisters name, or his weird friends name, who served zero purpose in the movie, accept serving as a loud mouthed joke teller. It was almost as if they wanted a Kevin Hart like star, but had to settle with Awkwafina? And Shang's sister? Just added nothing to the story or the movie. She looked NOTHING like Shang either, or her younger self, the casting was well off there.Ben Kingsley showing up was amusing, but honestly that was it when it cames to laughs. You could see every joke coming up 30 seconds before it was delivered, because it was a recycled joke from other Marvel superhero movie.Wong and The Abomination make a cameo appearance in this movie, but their addition is given NO CONTEXT, and makes zero sense, and adds nothing to the movie or their own stories.Overall, I'd just say every character felt, just like a Chinese copy or a character you've already seen in a Marvel movie before. By the end, I felt like I had watched a propaganda movie made by the CCP. It was like ordering a Chinese, except it came drowned in a bath of Chinese sauce, served on a bed of soggy Chinese mythology. Even the post credit scene wasn't worth sticking around to watch as it contains Marvel's most hated character to ever get a movie in it.",11 September 2021
PhatManBad," Computerized Atmosphere, Dull Story and Characters, A Few Good Parts","Awkwafina should not be the most interesting part of your $150 million kung fu movie.She wasn't great (sometimes she was a bit annoying, to be honest), but everyone else was forgettable. Shang-Chi himself was the generic ""slacker with potential"" character with no personality. And he was a live wire compared to the rest of the cast. Aside from Awkwafina, the others seemed to have picked one emotion (either stoic, angry, stern, or ""wise"") and stuck with it.Wait a minute, I forgot about Ben Kingsley. His appearance was a nice surprise (I think), but he was a wacky Disney animated movie sidekick with an awful-looking CGI pet monster (who was also a wacky Disney animated movie sidekick).Shang-Chi strikes me as an American-friendly martial arts movie. Not that I'm an expert on kung fu movies, but I've watched enough movies (including several Marvel movies) to know a factory-made action flick when I see it. The movie is very watered down.There was, for instance, no effort involved in developing a plot or telling a story whatsoever. It's almost the exact same plot as the CW's Kung Fu series. Family vs. Family.I wanted to enjoy the fight scenes (I can tell that a lot of effort was put into them), but everything looked fake. Obvious special effects mixed with artificial movie sets. The final battle was two giant cartoons wrestling each other.As a matter of fact, almost every scene in the movie was covered in computer graphics.I didn't hate the movie. I can see other people liking it. But I was bored most of the time.",5 September 2021

japongt, A tale of old...,"Alright! Just finished watching Shang-Chi!I have multiple gripes with this movie which is exactly what I was afraid of the moment the ""millennium-old league of assassins"" was introduced. Whether that be The Hand in The Defenders, the actual League of Assassins lead by Ra's Al'Ghoul in The Arrowverse, or even that one movie ""Ninja Assassin"": A main character without the proper resources, manpower, or even proper know-how is gonna come to bring it all down because... he has to! Somehow. Main character power!1) The trope of ""I'm really strong but I'm not home so take this time to kill my family"". Scorpion's story in Mortal Kombat, Dracula's story in Castlevania, etc. Unimpressed, old tale, but ok.2) This magical town has spent generations defending this gate that has sealed ""the big bad"" and they only have like, what, 50 people for the job? Guess they can't repopulate fast enough but ok.3) Homeboy with the magical rings comes in. Magical town is ready! Right? Nope, homeboy literally just walks past all of them. I guess the town really trusted the boy that arrived like a day early to take care of that for them, because why not? SPOILER: He doesn't.4) Mandarin's army is like... 50 people? Fighting vs like... another 50 people? They're both are awfully low in numbers and just break about even! Then for a league of assassins, they come with fancy rayguns to... incapacitate their enemies instead of kill. The power of PG-13! God forbid they would've come with some bombs, magical town would've been magically screwed. Nobody died here folks! Well, not unless their souls get sucked by Draconic Shang Tsung over there!5) Mandarin who's been a badass for a thousand years, mastering these rings for all that time, somehow lost them to this boy because I guess the boy learned a new trick the day prior. This is ""Ichigo learned bankai in only 3 days"" levels of plot reaching, and isn't exactly fooling anyone who's paying attention...
6) The girl who hardly knew how to shoot a bow the day prior gets to save the day by magically hitting the bullseye! Because, I guess none of the other actual bowmasters could! So prepared that town. Gotta give Akwafina something to do! She already got paid so gotta get your money's worth!All in all, 6/10 and I feel like that's a bit generous. Some action scenes were neat.",13 November 2021
paul_haakonsen, The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.My rating of ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars. Director Destin Denial Cretton ensured that this 2021 movie takes the role of the single best Marvel movie to date for me.",11 November 2021
valmont1702," Poetry in motion, layered story, emotional adventure. A sparkling jewel.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a wonderful movie in so numerous ways... Visually striking, with a great mastery of the staging from beginning to end.So much visual poetry, the legend/adventure aspect of it is really top-notch, with legends & mystical elements that grab you ever more with the story unveiling before your eyes ... The humor is very pleasant (Katy, played by Awkwafina, brought a welcome energy & heart in each of her scenes) and adds a pretty pleasant flavor to the whole adventure.I really loved the way the characters are written, with Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) as a complex & layered figure all along the movie... And Xialing (Shang-Chi's sister, played by Meng'er Zhang), as well as Li (their mother) are both highly enjoyable to see express themselves on-screen, they both have a lot of presence (and skills), each in their own ways.I found the entire movie very coherent, every detail makes sense and is counter balanced in a way or another... Yes, there is a strong notion of balance (darkness & light, and so on), with a lot of messages infused in both the action & dialogs. It is an extremely entertaining movie, but I really wanted to emphasize the richness and depth of its story/mythology and characters, all connected in the most organic way.By the way, I loved the whole Asian/Chinesz myths & legends aspec of the movie, the spirit & philosophy of it all was a true delight to my eyes, with countless Sci-Fi elements entwined in it, but all smoothly integrant of this mythology...
I think I probably put it in my Top 5 Marvel movies... I found the staging really majestic, from the dialog scenes to the action scenes, the humor, the flashbacks, and this new ""universe"" (mythology) that is presented here, it just all flows in such a delightful way from beginning to end.Marvel Studios always are very very clever at hiring a great variety of talents, and they nailed it once again... Destin Daniel Cretton (the director of the movie) is super creative and manages to construct pretty complex scenes while always masterfully telling a story, building a deeply cohesive piece ; it's all fantasy but nonetheless feels visceral and real. This movie is another Marvel movie you often forget that it is a Marvel movie, precisely because of its powerful and so deeply captivating mythology, and this emotional weight that you can feel over the characters, it truly sets something different. It felt like I was watching a movie in the vein of certain epic Asian adventure/martial arts movies... Gotta admit it's my jam, so... In addition to the Marvel stuff, it's a very pleasant feeling.The energy in the movie theater was fun, lots of people were excited from all these scenes that just grab you. Because yes, clearly... There is a good number of mind-blowing scenes in this incredible movie ! The photography and color treatment make the movie very striking... And like I said, certain scenes mesmerize you because of their beauty & mastery, or even their grand epicness ! At times, it feels like an epic fresco that you are contemplating.The scene when/where the two parents meet for the first time is beyond gorgeous (the setting, the colors, the choreography, the costume design and overall design, the music & sound effects, the characters and the atmosphere as a whole) ; an absolute masterpiece of art, visually way beyond sublime, what a gift for the eyes, wow... And the 'Grand Final' is quite simply epic, emotionally grabbing, and of course stunning visually, with a flow of glorious shots that all are impressive.A jewel.",1 September 2021
lukasvadum_, Decent film but nothing special,Incredibly cheesy and stereotypical superhero film. The acting was very 'meh'.Very weak written villain.Only redeeming parts were the cool weaponized rings and martial arts fight scenes.

We get it so why?Anyway the movie has some ok fight scenes but some of the camera work ruins going all around high low and it just makes look bad. Abomination looks horrible a real down grade in CGI. For the me ten rings do nothing for the main character or his father there is nothing special about them they can both fight without the use of them.The last hour of the film drags so much and is filled with CGI and is complete over the top not in a good way this movie feels completely rushed and because of covid they must have thought they had to but that is no excise the movie suffered greatly.Overall the downfall of marvel continues.",12 November 2021
jdesando, A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.",9 September 2021
bbevis-47954," Overhyped, Better than Average MCU Movie.","First thing first is the cast in Shang-Chi is excellent. Every performance is great and the chemistry between Shang and Katie is excellent. I am so glad the movie did not create a forced love-interest plot between the two friends. A few of the action sequences are good and better than what we received in Black Widow. The bus fight scene in the first third of the movie in particular is a standout.45 minutes into the movie when Shang-Chi is reunited with his father I was bored beyond belief until the last act of the movie. The film switches gears and continuously dumps exposition on the audience. Everything from here becomes the predictable hero needs to accept his true self story we have seen a million times. Which is a shame because the first act of the movie seemed so fresh from what we typically get with MCU movies. The fight in the last act, while entertaining, are the typical CGI mess found in marvel movies. The one on one between Shang and his father was genuinely emotional, but once you add all the CGI dragons/monsters it becomes a mind-numbing bore.Another thing that bothers me is the character development. Excellent performances aside none of the characters go through any deep growth. The story plays out exactly how you would expect with training montages, green screen vistas and humor ruining any moments of tension. For example, Katie seems to be unnecessarily dragged into everything, learns archery in a few hours, survives a vicious battle and hits the monster right in the neck from who knows how far away. It makes my eyes roll into the back of my head thinking about it. The same thing can be said about Shang's sister. The heart wrenching conflict between her and Shang is quickly resolved and there is no character development for her. It's all nonsense and I need a little more substance with my flashy action.All my gripes aside I was entertained in spurts watching Shang-Chi because of the chemistry between it's stars and some decent action scenes. Which makes it all the more frustrating that is falls into the typical MCU formula after it's first act. Marvel take some freaking risks with your story-telling please!",7 September 2021

The lead actor is boring in the film and pretentious outside the film...mocking fans, berating any constructive or genuine criticism, and spouting a bunch of foolishness on his social media that may get him canceled in the near future by one of the many angry Twittermobs. He basically is the male Brie Larson of the MCU. What could have been an action-packed, fun, exciting Kung Fu film in the MCU collapsed into a lame CGI-fest in the third act--think of the Dragon Ball Z or Avatar films that bombed at the box office. Once again, we had an overpaced origin story...watching Shang-Chi go from being an insecure valet, to getting kicked in the balls by his sister while shirtless in a cage fight with her...despite him being the ""Master of Kung Fu,"" only then to ""saving the universe"" in the third act...all in his first film...while also confronting his feelings and emotional issues with his father. He learns how to use the Ten Rings in a matter of minutes without any learning curve, which is ridiculous, and duels an evil dragon with his own good dragon. The rings aren't even the Mandarin's rings from the comics, but rather ten mystical bracelets. The supporting cast is forgettable, and the jokes are dryer than cracker-juice. Even Michelle Yeoh's star power is wasted and forgotten--most people don't even know she's in this film, which is a shame as she has helped pave the way for these lead and supporting actors and actresses in the film. The supporting actress Awkwafina feels outdated already, even though she just seems to be breaking onto the film scene as ""Marvel's Katy."" There is very bad chemistry between Shang-Chi and Marvel's Katy...what could've been a romance with a different, more competent actor/actress pairing and writer was more of the ""friend-zone"" at best. You definitely don't root for these two to fall in love and wonder if they even would. No chemistry, no tension...fully neutered...or possibly closeted (for now) to pander to a Chinese audience whose government wouldn't show the film in spite of pandering to them. Finally, Shang-Chi's sister is the real master of Kung Fu because she managed to become a better fighter than him, start an entire fight club in another country, all by watching him train and fight with Kung Fu masters while the patriarchy in her culture prevented her from studying martial arts with her brother. She learned her fighting skills all on her own...in the shadows at night-time...welcome to the ""M-She-U""...again...",4 November 2021
southdavid, 8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.",9 September 2021

The casts are just awful that even look worse than the employees from a grocery store, the acting and reactions are just so stiff, unconvincing, overacted and stupid. The cg is unrealistic with bad compositing that didn't blend well with the scenes, the story is totally cliche and lame, which was so predictable from start to finish. And the best thing above all is their intention to expand the china market by putting in all the chinese elements but got banned by china, well done disney.

ferreiranazli, one of the best solo movies on the MCU,"Visually, one of the most beautiful movies in MCU. More than that, one of the best solo super hero movies in MCU, a grand feat for a debut, even more so without other superheroes like ""crutch"". The performances make justice for the script, showing us that End Game, contrary to what was believed, wasn't the end of Marvel Era. The phase 4 promises be even greater than others. This quality can be easily compared to Black Panter and Captain America and The Winter Soldier level.Engaging and with the right dose between comedy and battle, the film has impressive fight choreographies.The credit scenes make connection between the Shang-Chi story to the MCU in a curious way. Can't wait to see what Feige is planning for the future.",6 September 2021

Action scenes (and there are plenty of them) were simply amazing. This is a one spectacular looking movie.Overall, superbly paced at running time 2 h 5 min this movie never dragged.

It's is one of the coolest origin stories I've ever seen (marvel or non marvel). The fight scenes were some of the best choreographed work you'll see, right up there with civil war and black panther. So awesome to get super powers along side of martial arts. The CGI was so amazing especially at the end. The comedy was perfectly placed. The music/film score was so well put together. It made the movie. Amazing movie. Excited for more! Stay for the mid and end credits. So glad this is proving that MOVIES ARE BACK.",2 October 2021

erfanul-51932, Same old lame a** marvel story,"The story suc*s literally.... Visual effects were pretty nice as usual. Some lame a*s jokes and dialogues and..........!Ohh that's all!If you observe this closely, you will also notice this movie had the tendency of antagonizing male characters and making female characters look good(Although no one would care for it as it's only bad for men)...Also very typical of marvel....",10 November 2021
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews, Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.",10 September 2021
S-t-a-t-i-x, Filler movie with bland characters that tries to be funny but isn't,"The start of the movie didn't feel like a Marvel movie. Even Black Widow felt more connected. Maybe it's because it was so clearly a tribute to Chinese martial arts movies. It just felt out of place.Despite it's runtime, the movie's rather rushed. Still, until the dragon statue receives its eyes (you'll know what that means if you've watched the movie, it's just another generic action movie with average CGI, too much forced humor and unintesting characters that were pretty dislikable, especially Katy. The only purpose she serves is comedic relief, but all she succeeds at is grief.The battle was so and so. No guns, although it's the 21st century. Despite his father using the Rings for a thousand years, Shang-Chi quickly masters wielding the Ten Rings because his mother has apparently trained him when he was young. I mean, if my parents taught me how to drive when I was five, no doubt I would've been able to drive any car to perfection two decades later. Right? Right. And then he proceeds to defeat the very big evil bad monster with little to no effort.The movie had potential, but it tries too hard to be funny and ends up spending too little time developing its characters. As a result, the only character with some depth was the bad guy... Later in the movie, this changes, and you think wasn't that bad afte-- SHABAAAMM, we're back in San Francisco with the forced humor bits and that just ruined the somewhat satisfying ending in the other world.Entertaining, but mildly frustrating.

Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist. Marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist, as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the Asian-American culture. Despite an overreliance on unnecessary, excessive exposition devices (narration, flashbacks, foreshadowing), the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest. From the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture, most Asian viewers will certainly love this film, even more than I do.

That's probably the funniest part of the movie. A very pleasant feeling to have him included in this film.Trevor Slattery. Glad they included him in this movie too.Tony Leung looks too Mr. Nice guy to be a villain.

evanston_dad, Fooled Again,"I really dislike Marvel movies. They're formulaic, generic, and loud. They don't care about story. They just assume that the audience watching them has low enough standards that they'll be satisfied by a bunch of chaotic stuff thrown on the screen, and given their total dominance of box office and movie theater screens, I guess they're right.Every so often, one will get good reviews that suggest it's something a bit different compared to other Marvel movies, and I'll get suckered into watching it because, hey, I want to have fun too! That was the case with ""Shang-Chi.""But.....uh.....no.....this movie is not very good. It starts out promising. I like Awkwafina and enjoyed her until the movie decides to dump her. I liked the marriage of martial arts and the Marvel universe until the action became a nonsensical mess. The visual effects that were Oscar nominated are pretty good I guess, but who cares? All visual effects look the same these days, and none of them are very impressive unless they serve a good story.Needless to say, won't be seeing the obligatory sequel.Grade: B-",1 April 2022

leoalexanderscott, Watchanle but opportunity missed.,"Ten Rings or is it Ten Bracelets? I will leave the research for you and the Marvel fans debate, and how accurate this movie is to the orignal comics. Focusing on this movie I must say it was flat right through until we get to the magical lands. Cultural mythical accuracy is sadly pushed aside by the writers and animators to retain a very standard plot. Characters' poor dialogues didnt help but the odd joke rarely did succeed. And I was very disappointed that there was a very poor attempt to capture the classical and contemporary Kung Fu element in the fights - it was limited and opportunity largely missed. If this movie was not apart of the next grandeur Marvel phase, I would have not be surprised to see another attempt/ reboot in five or ten years.",13 September 2021

sthomp15," The extra positive reviews are from ""woke white people"" who don't watch Kung Fu flicks lol","Marvel had a huge opportunity to make this so much bigger and better than just a premise movie.Beautiful cinematography and the choreography was more than just stunt work. Acting a little rough here and there, the protagonist actor did a pretty good job though. That dry MCU humor we've grown to see didn't quite hit. I know a lot of people wished they would have done much more with Mandarin as he is a pretty big bad in the comics and they hyped him up a lot. But I think this movie just makes people excited for THE NEXT marvel movie rather than truly giving this MCU story life. And with the movie being 2 hours long, it felt so rushed and at the same time most viewers were waiting for it to just end.And I'll say it, she could be a nice gal but Awkwafina....

Just felt like it didn't needed it. The movie got its own marvel flavor, when the cgi scenes took over.I had a lot of fun during watching. Specially the fighting scenes, action scenes and with a lovely humor.The acting was fantastic. Shang-Chi's character development was great just overshadowed by his fathers character in my opinion, cause the story of his father was somehow more interesting. The chemistry between Shang-Chi & Katy was the icing on the cake. So lovely and perfectly matches into the movie.This is the first Hollywood movie for Tony Leung.

harry_tk_yung, worthy re-entry into MCU,"For the Asian martial art genre, the evolution from kung-fu to wire-fu to CGI-fu is something to behold. ""Shang-Chi and the legend of the ten rings"" in fact has a bit of each. But then, it is much more than being just the latest addition to this genre. It is a re-assurance to fans that there is life after Avengers. It is one of the opening shots (another is Spiderman, and there are more coming) into the new Marvel Cinematic Universe. As well, it introduces more minority superheroes after Black Panther. There is indeed already one yellow, but Wong is only a sidekick to Dr. Strange. I used the word ""yellow"" not in any disrespectful way, but rather in the context that there is even a green among the major Avengers. Why not a yellow then, or two?The cast is solid. Carrying but not leading the movie are seasoned veterans Tony Leung (the entire movie) and Michelle Yeoh (the second half). Playing the protagonist, Simu Liu is surprisingly good, toggling effortlessly between poignancy and levity. Whatever role she plays, Awkwafina gives credibility to the character in a way that is a pleasure to behold. Meng'er Zhang is well cast. I think of LIU Yifei when Zhang's character appeared. But Liu, arguably prettier (""arguably"" because it's all in the eye of the beholder), would not have the right mix of defiance and vulnerability that Zhang capably delivered. Fala Chen has a heavier role than I expected and handled it capably. Icing on the top of the cake, somewhat of cameo roles are Ben Kingsley, YUEN Wah (an iconic martial art actor to those who are familiar with this genre) and Benedict Wong. I thought Wong is just a cameo at the beginning but he has a pivotal role in the end-credit teaser, together with Brie Larson and Mark Ruffalo, introducing our two protagonists into the post-Avengers MCU.Deftly directed Hawaiian born Destin Daniel Cretton, the movie sets up the story in two VO sequences. The opening sequence, rich with visuals, is narrated by Li (Chen), telling the story of the rise of XU Wenwu (Leung) who acquired amazing power upon coming into possession of the magical ten rings (not small ones worn on fingers, but large ones worn on the forearms, five each). After conquering through space and time, Xu seeks the mysterious lands of Ta Lo, finds it, and finally gets beaten by someone endowed with Ta Lo magic. Still in the VO, Li reveals that this is herself, and adds, ""And that is where I met your father"". After some further, somewhat vague, information, we move on to present day.In San Francisco, Shaun (Liu) and buddy Katy (Awkwafina) work as happy-go-lucky parking lot valets who take patrons' vintage vehicles left in their care for joy rides occasionally. Well, maybe not just occasionally, we don't know. The relationship between this pair, while warmly affectionate, seem platonic, at least at this point. Provoked to a maddening melee in a cable car, Shaun reveals an entirely different persona to Katy. Next thing you know, he has to go to Macau before his father Xu hurts his long lost-sister Xialing (Zhang). Katy won't let him off the hook so easily. ""You can explain it on the plane"" she quips.So here comes the next VO sequence, again with rich visuals, in which Shaun explains to Katy that he is really Shang-chi, who, after mother's death, ran away from despotic father, abandoning his little sister in the process.Next stage, Macau, where Shang-chi finds that Xialing, abandoned by him, has made it on her own, creator and owner of a plush fight club, and hating him for abandoning her. Next thing, Xu shows up, take the trio to his empire to join him in his scheme to find and burn down Ta Lo, to rescue his wife who he believes is not really dead but just held captive by her own people. The trio escapes, finds Ta Lo first to warn Shang-Chi's aunt, Ying Nan (Yeoh), who is now in charge. From here on, it is building to the climactic clash.The story is told with ably crafted narrative, together with capable acting, beautiful cinematography, and good CGI. The kung-fu style action is a welcomed new alternative to action sequences in the usual superhero movies. All in all, this is a worthy re-opening of the MC universe. More, please.",21 November 2021

I'm aware of the main actors comments about not being aware of Chinese heroes before himself somehow because he's done zero research and doesn't enjoy classic cinema in his own time.... and is a 2021 person and wants to just say things, virtue signaling I believe it's called.. but I'd recommend he check some of those movies out instead as they're much more interesting.",9 September 2021
archangestelle, No good writer left in Hollywood huh?,"The movie had some logical issues like why didn't the father take the necklace from his daughter first, he sent the postcard I think.The movie was entertaining but the end was BAD!Shang used the rings better than his 1000 years old father. The father should have helped to beat the soulsucker and then die after sealing it. Shang never used the rings (BRACELETS) before!And then they went home telling their friend about it, surprisingly happily considering how many died (including his father!).",11 January 2022

charbelelaro, Easily the worst aspect of the movie is the writing,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of The Ten Rings is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton. The movie centres around the Ten Rings Organisation, which is lead by Shang-Chi's father, who is a man that has been consumed by power and greed for thousands of years. This movie received so much praise, with many claiming this is one of the best instalments in the MCU. However after seeing the film, I have to say I was extremely disappointed. Easily the worst aspect of the movie is the writing. Almost every plot point occurs for no reason but to simply give the audience a purposeless action sequence or provide an exposition dump. To give an example, Shang-Chi's father sends his men to fight his children and we don't have any idea why. The action is cool to look at, and after three lengthy sequences it turns out he just wants them to return to his organisation. We find this out because the father shows up after all the pointless fights, and they just willingly go with him. Couldn't he have just shown up at the start of the movie? Like that would have been way more efficient for him. Basically the entire movie follows this trend. Even the fact that he wants his kid's help makes no sense. He didn't actually need them. He has the ten rings and an entire army to fight with. Like I get he needed their pendants to reveal a confusing useless map for 3 seconds, but couldn't he have taken the necklaces then left them alone? All this is really unfortunate because the execution of some action sequences are so great. Like Shang-chi's fight with his sister. I love hand to hand combat. But there was no purpose behind the fight. It's like someone just put the scene in because the movie got boring. Unfortunately, the movie does not end on a high either. I sat there having to stare at awful green screen and so much CGI, I couldn't help but laugh at it. Overall I thought this movie was watchable but extremely disappointing. There was potential to make a great film here, but to me it felt like marvel did not care about the script.",22 December 2021

shashrvacai, good entertaining and bollywood like,"Good entertaining and Bollywood like. It is loaded with action. Preferably watch on the biggest screen available.Marvel's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is much more than the trailer/teaser revealed! First ten minutes or so or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up.I think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation of Asian characters, especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. The film had a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time) The movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned.

freezwich, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"Apologies for draining Mandarin in ""Iron Man 3"" arrived late in the Marvel team, well, in full-length format, at least. True, and here everything is sad again. And also fabulous, just like Warner's neighbors, however, even those have a relatively gloomy fantasy world than a film about a mysterious terrorist organization known as ""Ten Rings"" - from which the Marvel Cinematic Universe began and what they fooled our heads about, if you like. , hinted in other films. The Marvelites should not lag behind anyone or anything, so it was necessary to burn down their magical world without blackjacks and strangers, but with a variety of creatures, including, his mother, dragons (not a mother, although we will see the mother of dragons). The mandarin or simply Xu Wenwu, thanks to the magic rings (and it is not known who he is to remove the rings) conquered the lands for centuries until he got tired of it. At the end of the last century, he began searching for a certain mysterious village, in which, according to legend, many mythical animals live. However, at the entrance he met love, with which he performed something like a dance, after which they got married and lived happily (this is not an Indian movie!). The worlds of ""Flying Daggers"" and ""Mood for Love"" converged - at this sweet moment it was possible to finish the film. But it was not there.The sweet story turned into children and a sudden death, after which Dad decided to raise a stern karate kid and a worthy successor, copying Oldboy in places. However, he grew up and merged into fashionable San Francisco, where he hung out with not the most pleasant girl performed by Aquafina. Marvel is too fond of keeping up with trends, and where necessary, socialist China will be represented by paradise, and women will rule the world, which is done so ostentatiously and unnaturally that it evokes the opposite feeling of tolerance. First, the most powerful person on earth is defeated in a battle with a villager, then a sister beats her brother, and another villager commands everyone, giving orders (well, we also watch the second scene after the credits, if we have enough patience). No one asks the conditional aunt Luda to stand at the stove all day, although if there were such a lady in the MCU, she would acquire an army or at least keep a barrel under an apron, but a sense of proportion is sometimes a necessary thing. And Aquafina, Shang-Chi's girlfriend, is responsible for a simple girl, but her heroine infuriates more than all the others put together due to poor humor, which has already turned into a kind of Marvel style or even a cliche, when a serious and even tragic story needs something yes, dilute so that the kids do not get bored. But sitting on all the chairs at once is extremely difficult.Shang Chi, or in the world, Sean, as expected, has to return to his native land in order to confront the same notorious ghosts of the past. Of course, the irritable companion leaves everything and everyone, rushing after him. As expected, he finds himself in his mother's native land, where a custom-made fashionable hero costume, as well as dance lessons, awaits him. And, of course, everything turns into another sterile mess (although the Russo brothers with a PG-13 rating did more interesting things), as if conveying ardent greetings to the Black Panther finale, and there are a bunch of other films. We've seen all of this a hundred times already, as well as the hero going crazy after losing his wife, and all these mythical creatures and serious fights would be appropriate if Marvel set the right tone. Alas and ah - everything turned into a continuous and familiar buffoonery, where there was even a place for Sir Ben Kingsley, who was again given to play a fool, because one fool is not enough for a film. Maybe the picture will delight the Chinese, and they will fall from laughter under the chairs of cinemas from so many clichés and cranberries, but they are probably already accustomed to this, and only openly yawn, they say, they have not seen this. And all this half-epic will again be trolled in the conditional ""Avengers 5"", although no - the Marvelites have already successfully done this by the end of the film, because the tragedy is not a tragedy, that the epic battle is ridiculous, but the brutal Thanos, meanwhile, is already completely obscene in the parallel running animated series ""What If ...""
The main problem of Marvel is an unsuccessful attempt to please everyone, and at the same time a careless attitude towards projects like Shang-Chi, which stand apart, that is, they are not particularly tied to the global plot of the MCU, even if they are referring to it with all their might. And the most offensive thing is that there was some potential, the idea could really turn into something more entertaining, but not in this MCU, probably. Such films often act as a kind of postcard and agenda supporting the brand's status. And popular brands must adhere to certain frameworks and ideologies, which is self censorship, which is more harmful than the other way around. They shoot films every three or four times - the same ""Avengers"", in which there is a lot of action and a much more global plot, and special effects that are needed. After all, the audience always wants more, which is why all the bets on films like ""The Multiverse of Madness"" and ""No Way Home"" - the main thing is not to drain the good old villains there, or even, you see, Spiderman. But ""Shang-Chi"" respect only for the glorious ""Hotel California"".",26 November 2021

kjproulx, A Very Fresh MCU Entry,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.",3 September 2021
beladornon2, A huge dud,"This is the first Marvel film since 2012's The Avengers that I would call a big dud. The reasons for its failure are many; the reasons that it almost succeeds are exactly two: Nora Lum (Awkwafina) and Ben Kingsley. Aside from these two shining points of light, the film's an energetic flop.The main reason for the failure is the script. Now, I have been watching movies for five decades, and I can tell when a film is paying homage to another film, and when it's just ripping off the ideas of a better movie. This 'script' rips off a series of better movies, starting with Deadpool 2, then Fight Club, then Skyfall, then Avatar, and probably a bunch of other action films I never saw. Along the way, we are asked to accept a silly premise that these magic rings and the bad guy wearing them have existed for a thousand years. Nope. Just a dumb idea. One look at his gleaming and perfect thousand year old teeth and the whole thing falls apart. The film never recovers from that.Next, there is the spectacularly bad directorial choice (from the aptly named Destin Cretton) to have all the actors in the film display no emotions with their faces whatsoever. As mentioned above, the sole exceptions are Awkwafina and Kingsley. Every other actor, AND ESPEICALLY PRETTY-BOY LEAD SIMU LIU, seems to be a star graduate from the Kristin Stewart school of blank stares. Boo. Maybe Cretton was going for Inscrutable, but all we see is Constipated.The fight scenes are all generic karate video game stuff, boring at first glance, but unbearably dull after two hours. The music by Joel West is one blaring trumpet after another, so forgettable that I can't remember anything except constant boring noise.The production design is wonderful, as we expect from Marvel: sets dripping in vivid color, crisp and exciting visuals, wonderful costumes. There are many beautiful and talented Asian actors on display here, but the script is so awful that I felt embarrassed for them. As I said, Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley save this film from being a complete flop, and their two performances are so wonderful that I am almost willing to let the rest of the garbage slide.Almost.",11 October 2021

cherold, Fun martial arts action-comedy with some dragon ex machina,"After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character."" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights.

alejandroalcantara_, A rough introduction.,"""You can't outrun who you really are"".60/100What Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings provides, besides a really long title, would be considered an exceedingly new perspective of what the MCU can offer. It's one of those marvel movies that, despite its defects, stands out from most superhero films, something almost impossible to do these days...Marvel has a reputation of creating great origin stories for its characters, at least establish the basics of them, orderly making the audience sympathize with them. Shang-Chi is no exception. It establishes the future role of this character and its importance on the MCU, but a deeper analysis into his past must be needed in order to make him go through the good ol' hero's journey, something that the movie tried to accomplish, but was left incomplete while trying to prioritize some plot points.That's another thing with this film: a sense of incompletion. It tries to set up so many aspects and characters that, it forgets to conclude anything :/. The final act doesn't help either; having some of the most horrible looking CGI I've ever seen in a Marvel proyect and tiktok-worthy green screen effects.Maybe the character of Shang-Chi will leave me a better taste in my mouth as we see more of him in the future but, right now, it feels like a bumpy start to the introduction of a promising character.Also, the funny tones hit surprisingly well..... huh, who would've thought I would say that about a Marvel film....",13 November 2021
PerryAtTheMovies, Fantastic if you don't know the comic story....,"Overall: 91/100This is more geared towards non-Marvel people than for the Marvel people.Quick & Dirty: I loved it and would highly recommend seeing this film in theatres. Visually stunning, fantastic fight scenes, great story, and emotionally driven. Due to one too many lulls perhaps a slight bit too long in length, but overall, very enjoyable.When I was teen I loved watching Asian films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", & ""Ong-Bak"". This film had the great martial arts fighting sequences that the aforementioned films had. I felt like I was a kid again enjoying something fresh and new. I also fully enjoyed the combination of Mandarin (apologies if that's wrong) and English. A movie with subtitles always reminds me that there's more than the bubble of North American film.The acting was great. Michelle Yeoh was the one who stole the show for me at the end of the day. Again, it reminded of the good old days of martial arts movies that depended on the actors to make things believable instead of lots of CGI.I watch virtually zero Marvel movies and so if you're iffy on whether to watch this or not it shouldn't stop you from enjoying this film. It's funny, action packed, and does not appear to be culturally inappropriate. The acting is great and the length of the film, while a little long, is still exceptional.PS... there are two after the credits scenes so make sure you have time sit until the very end.Enjoy the show!",3 September 2021
vithiet, Entertaining but still not 'old' MCU level,"I have to admit I've been pretty disappointed with every MCU movie since Endgame so I was pleasantly surprised by Shang-Chi, which I didn't really have high hopes for (the last Marvel martial arts based hero was Iron Fist, and that was a turd). This movie was very entertaining even if it had a pretty generic and predictable storyline, and special effects were fairly uneven (amazing 'MCU quality' along with pretty terrible early 2000s CGI).

hiraishinnojutsu, Marvel with a touch of Jackie Chan and some wire fu,"I'm pretty well aware that I'm late to the party because I wasn't interested at first, but the more I think about its high ratings and scores, the stronger my urge to think like ""Well, there's no harm watching it once, is there?"". Well, to honest, it's pretty decent. MCU with a touch of Jackie Chan's ""Police Story"" series with some elements of wire fu that you can find in 2000's ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and 2002's ""Hero"", because, you know, all of those ancient China settings. It's pretty intense at first, gets a little boring in the middle, then becomes action-packed again by the third act, though it's going a little bit too rushed. The CGI is pretty standard, MCU standard, which means good, not great, not terrible. Love Simu, he really looks like he's having fun with the role he's given; Awkwafina's character isn't as annoying as I had thought it would be; and as usual, like I've been saying about the MCU: some of the jokes are cringey or don't land very good at best, but it's just me tho, I don't know about you guys, maybe you'll find it funny you'd laugh your ass off, or just smile a little, who knows?

cruise01," Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.",3 September 2021

The story wasn't what i was expecting, but you can't put the whole family drama that the main character has in 2 hours. What really bothered me was Awkwafina. WTF? What is she doing in there the whole time? I'm tired of these silly non important characters that ruin everything. She should've stayed in California and disappear. Fun movie tho. Also... DISNEY STOP RUINING OUR GOOD STUFF!!!!!",13 November 2021

grillmasterj," It's like a 80's kung-fu movie of old (well, mostly)","I have to agree with another reviewer here...it's probably the least Marvel of all the Marvel movies. Had it been edited to a certain effect, one would not be able to discern it as a Marvel film.It's a background story of Shang-Chi obviously, but in a way, I felt like Tony Leung stole a bit of the show. It's his anguish that drives the film, as without it, there wouldn't be a conflict between him and Shang. Seeing Tony onscreen after so many years makes me want to go on a Tony Leung marathon, or at least watch Hard-Boiled again. He's always been so good at conveying emotion without words.Michelle Yeoh has small part in the film, but as always, she kicks ass and more or less plays the same exact role she played in the recent Gunpowder Milkshake as the older, wise Auntie.Simu Liu and Awkwafina have good chemistry in the film, but I actually felt like their characters otherwise were a little bit flat, as there was not much time spent on character development. Or at least in the character of Shang, alot of time devoted to flashbacks but little time spent with Simu in the present day, fleshing out his character. They seem like they would be fun people to hang out with? Awkwafina is vital to a plot moment, but otherwise, she has little presence other than a few small comedic moments but maybe that is enough.Morris is cute. I need to find that stuffed animal...The special effects are fun to watch and colorful.The plot is a bit simplistic, as it usually is with Marvel films. It's serviceable enough, but the film starts to fall apart during last 1/3-1/4 of the film when the fantastical elements show up and certain things happen that don't quite make any sense (or at least I haven't worked out why they should make sense). The fantasy elements don't quite work as well as just watching all the fight choreography from the earlier parts of the film, it's just not as interesting to me personally.All in all, a good time and a great prelude to a Labor Day weekend!",3 September 2021

kennyj-658-507525, It's a fun MCU ride with some hidden ingredients to make it stand out,"Tony Leung and Fala Chen was the standouts in this movie (in my own humble opinion). Something about their performances struck a chord with me and those two really got me into this movieThe movie is a fun action/fantasy ride, some cool shots and set pieces but it also suffers from those boring PG-13 fights most of the time, it got kind of gritty at some parts which was very welcome.Simu Liu and Awkwafinas relationship felt a little ""manufactured"" at first like there was no chemistry there but it got better as the movie went along, maybe their first scenes together were among the first being shot?The CGI was not the best, at some places it was painfully obvious where they've added CG when you kind of didn't need it and a practical effect or prop could have been used and that is something the MCU doesn't do too well overall.Another thing I really, really liked was the fact that there was more chinese spoken than I anticipated, that always ruins movies/shows/games when everyone speaks English to one another (even if they are in this case Chinese or whatever the setting may be).But, despite the fact that there was more Chinese spoken than I anticipated there was also a whole lot of English spoken solely between characters that aren't native English speakers. For example between Shang-Chi and Wenwu during their final fight, it's just those two no Americans or other around.",3 September 2021
Cinephilia1508, Worst Marvel movie ever,"I am not sure what other people watched but this movie is so boring. There is nothing new here which you haven't watched before. If you are praising it for the Kung-Fu then better go and watch Chinese movies with a lot more Kung-Fu action and better story than this one.Here is my take with spoilers-1. They showed the main guy's father i.e The Mandalorian which was shown in Iron man 3(The fake one) is alive from thousand year and he is very brutal & has won hundreds of battles and blah blah blah...then how come a guy who has won so many battles doesn't even have a billion dollar even after thousand year.When he gets marry to the love of his life i am sure he wants to give her all the happiness but the guy is poor.Some local mafia people come to his house to take their money which he owes them but he wasn't at home that time and they kill his wife.I mean WTH is this?The director actually thought that a brutal, passionate king alive for thousand year with ten rings power can't even provide basic things to his family even after winning hundreds of battles.Who came with this plot?2. Our main guy i.e The hero of the story Shang chi is living the life of a valet. His father sends his people to get a locket from him which his mother gave him and his sister.Shang-chi and his father's goons fights off almost killing everyone in the bus and ruining at least a dozen cars but goons takes off the locket.Then hero goes to warn his sister and there also his father's goons fight off.After a long fight and almost 20-30 people dead his father comes in the scene and says he wanna take them home.I mean WTH again?If he wanted to take his kids home then why send his people to fight and let die so many people to get 2 lockets.Just speak to the kids and ask them to come home.3. They go home and his father plans to attack his wife's native place as he thinks she is alive and living there. Those 2 lockets shows the map of the village and the kids disagrees and father locks them.There they meet the fake Mandalorian from iron man 3(Ben Kinsley) & escapes with him as he has one of the animal from their mother's village who knows the map to the village.Oh man i am so tired of writing this.So by now u know they reach the village and even there father reaches there very easily and fight happens.Our hero gets the ten rings and saves everyone on a dragon.It really can't get worse than this.We all have seen so many action vfx movies by now that nothing amazes anymore.After watching marvel for more than 10 years we really don't deserve these underdog superhero stories.These are becoming so boringWe deserve better.I have no idea what people liked in this and why this movie has so high rating.",21 November 2021
stevendbeard, On A Dark Desert Highway.....,"I saw ""Shang_Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", starring Simu Liu-Taken_tv, Kung Fu Cops; Awkwafina-Jumanji:The Next Level, Ocean's Eight; Tony Chiu_Wai Leung-The Grandmaster, Hard Boiled and Michelle Yeoh-Star Trek:Discovery_tv, Mechanic:Resurrection.This is the first Asian Marvel super hero movie that is based on a minor-not as well known-character. I grew up loving 'The Master of Kung Fu' because of the martial arts aspect and still have the original comic books. FYI: Shang_Chi was originally based-visually-on Bruce Lee. Paul Gulacy-one of the artist at the time-even drew Shang_Chi to look like Bruce Lee. They also made changes-mainly because of political correctness-to his origin story. Originally, Shang_Chi was the son of Fu Manchu, a racially insensitive character. But now, it has been changed to be the son of The Mandarin, an old Iron Man villain. In the comics, The Mandarin had 10 rings on his fingers but here it has been changed to rings on his forearms. These rings shoot energy force bolts and Tony also calls his evil organization, 'The Ten Rings'. Simu plays Shang_Chi and Tony is the Mandarin. In this origin story, you learn what caused their estrangement and why Tony is wanting so badly to reconnect. Awkwafina plays Simu's best friend that tags along on Simu's adventures with glimpses into his past & present life-and lots of fantastic martial arts-and Michelle play's Simu's aunt. If you like The Eagles, you'll probably enjoy the connection to 'Hotel California'. There are several cameos, including a couple of Avengers. As the end credits start, there is a scene and another one at the very end so don't leave too early.It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",4 September 2021
gangstah_vino, Almost a perfect origin movie!,"Mannnn... this movie is good.Let me... just say.. first of all.. OMG THE FIGHTS! THE ACTION! OH.. MY.. GOD. Marvel did it again after having a slight setback with the just okay black widow movie. This movie has the best fight scenes I've seen since the raid films. The fights are so well choreographed but also fast paced and filmed to perfection. The bus fight is incredible!!!!! The fight in the beginning between the mandarin and the mother.. wow wow wow...
OKAY Back to reality. This movie does have flaws. First of all the pacing in like the 3/4rd of the film is a tat slow. The score honestly is weak. Might be my theater but there were moments where the score had to make me feel something and (credits to the movie itself that it let me ) i had to do that all by myself.The plot sometimes leans to a pretty basic plot, but because of the great screenplay it works.Cinematography was amazing. The acting was good. And the special effects were very good. One thing that I have to admit. Game of thrones kind of spoiled us with the design of .. a particular mythical creature so... that won't look as great as it could've been but still very good.But man the fights were incredible.. the camera work was so good. Fluent movements but fast and I could see EVERYTHING. After snake eyes I thought I would never see a good martial arts movie again considering how average that was.Thank you, shang chi. You made my night.9 out of 10. Welcome back marvel.",1 September 2021
Amthermandes," Decent, but most DEFINITELY overrated. The novelty is wearing thin for Marvel","If you rarely are disappointed with Marvel films, and you consider yourself a big fan of them, then you will most likely enjoy this film. It's certainly better than a few of the last installments (by a small margin), but this film is proof to all others that there really aren't any fresh ideas anymore, and the Marvel antics are getting rather boring.You have good guy who is lackluster in personality, has some family issues, turns out he's a very important guy in the world, has some impressive abilities which he hones, discovers things about himself, has someone close to him betray him, has to make some big decisions, engages in climactic fight, the end.These movies are so cookie-cutter, all Marvel is now, is predictable pomp and circumstance with flashy lights and SOME, not many, redeeming qualities. Let's start with those first:Choreography. There are some slick-nasty moves in most of the fight scenes. Action scenes, and entertaining fights is certainly one thing Marvel rarely disappoints.Humor. Another typical trait of a Marvel film, you get some good chuckles here and there. However without Awkwafina, this trait would be almost non-existent. And this is coming from someone who usually doesn't care for the smarky humor of the latest generations. But she is rather funny without being TOO annoying and sarcastic.Special effects and cinematography. Solid work, obviously they didn't downsize their SFX department. But compared to the bar set by previous movies in the Marvel world, it's not all that impressive.On to the unflattering traits:Story. WOOF. Predictable through and through, don't expect much of anything here. They could easily have held a writing competition at any average middle school for the students to write a basic action movie script, and the storyline for this film would have probably been the entry from the kid who won 3rd place.Characters. Aside from a a select few, the characters are as flat as a pancake in a hydraulic press.The humor and the action. While I mentioned this earlier as a pro, over time, it all got old towards the end. The attempts at humor starting falling short of the goal, and the action became stale.It's about time to wrap up this dynasty of Marvel movies and move onto something else before it starts to smell like discarded scraps of reused ideas, and accumulate maggots of banality.",23 September 2021
nlsteven-attheMovies, The Best Fight Club,"Shang-Chi is hands-down the best Asian representation film. It took a while for Marvel to make a martial arts film, and they certainly couldn't have done better by roping in Destin Daniel Cretton for his character-driven directing repertoire and Tony Leung - the master of Asian cinema - for his first English language role. The fight choreography is the highlight of the movie, while the newish cast - Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Me'gher Chang deliver memorable performances playing their action hero roles with a touch of humour. The film's climax - with dragons and monsters - feels somewhat cheesy after its brilliant first half, but hey it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without CGI monsters. Overall, Shang-Chi is a fun movie for multiple repeated viewings.",31 October 2021
AscendeSuperius, Chinese culture finally done right,"After the Mulan remake, it was safe to say that I was thoroughly disappointed, the portrayal of Chinese culture, even in the mystical sense, just felt like a disaster. But this one, oh this one was so much better. I was actually impressed. It felt like it was actually catered to a different market this time. While someone unfamiliar with Chinese culture may find it to be 'just another Marvel movie(albeit an amazing one), to those who know, you will be treated to something that has been basically non existent in Hollywood films, aka inside jokes/depth of knowledge that really helps elevate the film to a whole nother level.",30 September 2021
SeriousMayhem, Not much of a legend,"This movie leaves a lot to be desired.The CGI is mostly well done, although not consistent throughout, with some pretty bad moments as well.The action scenes are nicely done, but after the umpteenth martial arts fight scene, I have to admit, it grew a bit weary on me.The story, while not truly bad in itself, is thin as paper and meanders along for too long, making the total runtime about half an hour too long in the process. It's also way too Disney; that new, not so good kind.It's all pretty generic in the end, seemingly providing a sort fan service (or quite frankly pandering) to the Chinese audience more than anything else, by trying to cram as much Chinese mythology and history in it as possible. But also just as many stereotypes and clichés. It's all very shallow and it even went into shameless territory a couple of times, which is just weird.Acting is decent to good, but the woman playing Jar-Jar Binks, no I mean Legolas, no I mean Katy, got annoying real fast.With everything they had at their disposal to make a great movie, this sure could have been a whole lot better.6/10, barely.",12 November 2021

No)3) the music was good but not epic and there is no great theme for shang chi (I loved the music and the songs but it wasn't good enough)Overall good action movie with a great action sequences and good comedy and good villan and cinematography and cgi, but it's a *marvel* movie, with cgi final battle and weak ending and a good setup for what comes nextThank you for reading my quick review, this is my opinion, the more important is your opinion and remember not everyone one love the same thing.",3 September 2021

It's not a Marvel movie, it's a martial arts movie with Mystic elements.It's actually good in its own way, but it certainly doesn't get that Marvel feel in all the previous movies.

liesl-li, A beautifully unique marvel movie,"As an Asian American, it is so excited to see a new series on Asian characters. Thank you Marvel!This could be the best visual representation of Kongfu among Hollywood movies, especially the part between Shang-Chi's dad and mom.The music is amazing too.I wish the understanding to Asian culture could have been deeper tho.For example, when the history was introduced by Shangchi's Aunty, it was wooden sculpture used to visually present it. But in ancient China, when good things are documented, they were carved on stone monument and when bad things happened, they were documented in books.The essence about Yin-Yang, why Shang Chi's mom could easily handle his father's 10 rings Kong fu, was not presented clearly at all. It's a lot more than 'knowing who you are'.When I checked out writers, I think understood why. I guess at least there could have been a consultant who understood those part to help drafting the story details, because those are real gems from Asian culture and it was deep wisdom.But, these did not block me from enjoying the movie.

akellashashank, An enjoyable ride throughout.,""" If you aim at nothing, you get nothing ""Shang chi gets most of the part right with crazy action choreography which is undoubtedly the major attraction. First act is racy and has crazy action episodes and later, the recurring flashbacks served the story purpose but at the same time, slightly hindered the flow. Not a big issue though as the action part kicks in and makes up for it. Third act ten rings action visuals are pretty damn good and the water formation is breathtaking which reminded me of Raya.New guy "" Simu Liu "" owned the Shang chi role, as his efforts are clearly visible on the screen. Especially during action episodes , he nailed it with his quick reflexes, even Meng'er Zhang as Chi's sister did put up an impressive act and Awkwafina provided a bit of humor with her quirky attitude . Fala Chen is so beautiful, i fell head over heels for her smile. The man, Tony Leung stood tall and delivered with panache, his presence worked big time. Always love to see Michelle Yeoh on the screen , she got that aura which pulls me in. Trevor and Morris stole the show, loved their bonding :)Over all , with couple of surprises , good performances , amazing score , striking visuals and top notch action pieces makes this one an enjoyable ride throughout.

afrocut, Surprisingly good time,"I'm super happy to say that Marvels newest movie outing, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", is a hilarious, action packed, CGI thrill ride and it's a fantastic one at that. After seeing ""Black Widow"" I was worried that Marvel/Disney had started shifting their focus to their very ambitious TV mini series projects and left the quality of their movies behind. I'm now confident that isn't the case. Here, sets, visuals, costumes, choreography, score, acting and directing are all top notch. Each shot feels fresh and visually stunning. Each joke and emotion land. And the action is amazing. The first big set piece involving Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) and his best friend (awkwafina), is a bus ride to work gone horribly wrong, it hooks you instantly and has you either in awe with its incredible fight choreography or laughing at the perfectly timed jokes. It really doesn't let up in either category going forward. I can't believe how much I loved the pairing of these characters, their choice to not make it romantic and I love how different and real they feel from other characters in the MCU. Often Marvels problem has been their reliance on the same personality traits for their heroes, funny jerks with over confidence or bumbling idiots thrust into power. Here the main character is naturally a good person, hes comfortable with being himself and with his best friend, when power comes to him he accepts, he never truly stops being him, he doesn't have to learn a lesson, he just rolls with the punches. Almost all of this goes to actor Simu Liu who brings an extra dose of likability to the role, along with the chemistry he shares with Awkwafina which makes their friendship believable. There's even great references, cameos and credit scenes for the fans looking for that. Of course there are problems, the biggest is the big CGI slug fest ending that plagues these types of films, when all it truly needed to do was be smaller. It's a mess of CGI at times and feels a little too big and too rushed. Characters just instantly know and understand things and accept everything with ease. It is easy to over look all this, with how much fun you'll have.",3 September 2021
jaschakuehlkamp," Strong start, heavily subsided","The first 2/3 of the film are pretty strong. The story is well laid out and the battle scenes look good.

alexscott-35299, An amazing dive back into the marvel universe!,"I was super excited for this film and at the start of the year it was probably my most anticipated film of the year. It definitely did not disappoint me! This film is massive fun, massive action and has massive heart. The action scenes are so cool and the choreography is amazing in the fight scenes and the martial arts look so good. I love the jokes between the two main characters and the banter they have together is great fun. This is a good way to do an origin film this far into the MCU, it sort of flicks between flash backs and the present day and it keeps the pacing of the film fresh and quick. Shang-chi as a character isn't super well known but just like the guardians of the galaxy I think he will become a household name. The shots in this film are gorgeous at times and have some beautiful bright colours and amazing Chinese settings. Some of the effects fail a little bit but it's not enough to harm the film at all. I loved this film and I'm so happy to be back into the marvel universe once again!",3 September 2021

Gpanther67, A Middle-of-the-road film that should have been better,"Marvel's newest solo film that introduces an iconic hero from thier vast collection of heroes is certainly for the newer fans that didn't grow up with ""The Master of Kung-Fu"". Even Stan Lee (who was in charge of the company but didn't create Shang-Chi) has admitted he was a comic rip-off of Bruce Lee in looks and style. Adding a mystical and possible alien influence was in my view a mistake and not true to the character's story. Nor the reimaging of The Mandarin, which I found to be disappointing. Aside from the tired storylines which have become common in these Marvel films, the ending was a little over the top. Aside from these criticisms, I'll give kudos to a good cast and wonderful cinematography. If I ever get a faithful adaption of a Marvel comic I grew up with, I might be shocked. I am coming to the conclusion that these films are only for those under 30, since I don't recognize the heroes or villains. Not the worse film in the Marvel universe but not the best.",9 September 2021
maximfilipenko, Probably one of the worst MCU movies,"The film contains a lot of confusing plot points that really make the whole story look underwhelming and uninteresting.Why is Shang Chi's father so blind (or stupid) that he cannot see he is being deceived by some otherworldly being? Even after he sees that he released some kind flying demons out? And after Shang Chi tried to politely explain him this a few times?Oh, and the father was just wasted within seconds and the mega-powerful ten rings didn't help him much.And this otherworldly being... The CGI monster. What exactly is it? It turns out to be the main villain of the film, but it's hard care about it at all.I loved the jokes in the movie, and the first hour was fine, but the rest is just disappointing.",2 September 2021

sflanagan-47676, Overall Pretty Good,"It was great to see one of the many MCU martial artist in live action and actually living up to their comic character (Iron Fist Netflix series blows btw). The fight scenes were fantastic along with the other action sequences. Most of the characters were easy to sympathize with and the cameos were great.The only thing I personally felt that didn't go over very well was Aquifina's performance and comedic lines. It felt a little flat and I thought Ben Kingsley was way more funny than her. If it wasn't for the fact she shot the evil soul sucker in the throat saving Shang Chi and his sister, you could have left her out or played her character without all of the comedic misses and it would have been fine.As mentioned however my son and liked the movie and it provided a nice lead in to the next big bad guy of the MCU (maybe Mephisto?).

This movie didn't feel like a typical Marvel film, and that's why I liked it so much. The character work is very well done, you enjoy the energy everyone brings to the scene and the movie stands firmly on it's own. The last Marvel film I saw was Blackwidow and that was a stinker for me.Shang-Chi was a more than capable step up.

thedongwu, The Marvel formula done right,"An incredible MCU film. It offers nothing too cerebral, but that is not the main focus of the film. The comedy, the action, the themes, the choreography and the vibrant visuals make this film a standout among similar standalone Marvel films, while the layered and truly epic soundtrack is the finishing touch. While some of the effects and the pacing perhaps could have been a little more polished, and the final battle had some weaknesses, this is a colourful, emotional and fun rollercoaster of a film. Tony Leung is by far the standout member of the cast, delivering a captivating and even sympathetic villain. Simu Liu holds his own, but needs more time to really shine as a new Marvel superhero-while Meng'er Zhang, Awkwafina and Fala Chen are integral to this film's effectiveness. Overall, this fun and touching movie is an exemplar of the 'Marvel formula' and its strengths.",4 September 2021

namob-43673, Finally something good again from Marvel,"Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show. Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.This movie however is not a failure.Why?This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah, too bad"" about him.This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored.",3 September 2021
drawlife, Tony Leung is MVP.,"I can tell you the reason to see this film is solely based on the performance of the incredible Hong Kong actor Tony Leung as Shang-Chi's father Wenwu aka the real MANDARIN. He literally carried this film on his back. For those who aren't film buffs, Tony Leung is basically Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington and Brad Pitt combined in Hong Kong. Even though Hollywood has knocked on his door a few times, finally, better late than never, he gets his due in Hollywood.Simu Liu throughout most of the film, I thought was alright, nothing too special, nothing too terrible. However, he has two incredible moments in the film where then I was completely sold on his character. A great display of acting, one of which involves a scene with Tony Leung where he calls out his failure as a parent. What I also admired is that Shang-Chi also has blood on his hands. He reveals this to Awkwafina's Katy and Simu doesn't overdo his performance in that scene. You felt his anger, his guilt and his remorse. This reveal reminded me he almost killed the Death Dealer, seeing and knowing this makes his character a bit more rich and complex. I appreciated that he wasn't a saint.The relationship between Shang-Chi and his father Wenwu on the surface does involve superhero theatrics, however underneath it, it does have a very relatable dynamic. As an Asian myself, I think it will hit home to most Asians and their relationship with their parents.But despite all that, I did not love the film like I wanted to. It still falls under the same old formulaic humor I despise, mainly coming from Awkwafina. I will however concede that I did expect the humor to be a lot worse and thankfully it isn't too unbearable. But if it were up to me, ""less is more."" I had some inkling that Sir Ben Kingsley would show up and he does add the redundant humor into the mix.Although it works on some level, the story mainly lumbers along, obsessed with backstory. On the one hand I did feel the drag, but in the other I felt the flashbacks did help flesh out Wenwu, Shang-Chi and his sister Xialing whom Meng'er Zhang does a good job portraying. Fala Chen also had a great supporting role as Shang-Chi's mother.While the creatures showcased in final act are pretty cool like the Great Protector, I particularly disliked Morris the faceless chicken-pig that accompanied Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery and found the addition very unnecessary. Speaking of unnecessary Florian Munteanu's Razor Fist was not needed. I felt all his screen time could have been devoted to the Death Dealer who I was more interested in.I also did feel like they took some tropes and traditions of Asian cinema and did not present anything unique on their own take and in doing so I got this feeling that at least half of the film did not know what it wanted to be other than an Asian American hero in the MCU.To sum it up, a stellar first half, where then Marvel eventually goes back into their comfort zone by the third act. Despite Tony Leung's magic as a performer and Simu Liu's best efforts it is ultimately another okay entry to the MCU as opposed to the top tier level films that took big swings like INFINITY WAR, the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy or the first GUARDIANS. Again, being an Asian myself I wanted to love this film, but I didn't, I just thought it was okay.Two post credits scenes so stay put.7/10.",3 September 2021

deothor, Beware of hundreds of fake reviews praising this movie to heavens and beyond. Here's my take on Shang Chi.,"This movie is both fine, yet very flawed. The first issue is pacing. It's quite exhausting. Action-break-flashback-action-flashback-action-break-break-break-flashback-action. It's as if you tried to first sprint, then suddenly halt and tip-toe-walk and then run a marathon only to sprint again.Second issue are flashbacks. This movie is riddled with them. And I don't mind them.. Unless they keep on returning to exactly the same scene over and over and over again with that difference that you get to listen to new part of the talk. I don't remember any other movie that was so riddled with flashbacks.Third issue are fights. Now this has to be broken in 2 groups; ""magical fights"" and ""down to earth fights"". The first was done terribly. Camera shake, way too close, badly lighted and confusing as heck. There was some vision, some idea, yes, but it turned into ""cgi slosh"". This could have been done oh-so-much better.. But we got pointless confusing close-ups then camera shaky-shaky moments instead. The second group reminds me of jackie chan movies, you know.. kung-fu stuff, which was great... To some extend.Fourth issue is main character. He's the extend from point earlier. He's like blank-slate punching bag in this show. He has no real emotions and just goes with the flow. He >never< speaks his mind and rather just silently mumbles his agreement for whatever plan others come up with. It was annoying. Really grating. Ok, I don't mind if MC is not an iron man of a character. But I had seen corpses put more action while being decomposing than Shang chi. Also he gets beaten pretty much all the time. There are only 3'ish exceptions where he shows real emotions. And again.. shoddy pacing cripples them slightly.The Second character, his friend - Katey (i think).. she was fine. She was active and I couldn't shake this feeling that she's the brains of the team with witty humor, while he's broody muscle man with past.There were few amazing scenes, which i loved alot, really. But beyond that it was just mediocre. Thank god it was ""just"" mediocre, considering what things marvel relases lately. Mediocre is fine. Really. Tiresome, extended to the point of exhausting... But fine! A (not so) solid 7!Oh also, there are quite a few plot holes and whatnot ranging from minor (assassins using stun weapons ONLY - lol) to extreme (spoilery stuff).. but at this point.. i just can't even bother. Just roll my eyes and force my brain to stop thinking about it. To become a script writer in 202x all you need to know is how to sniff glue with class and how to agree to everything corporate monkeys in expensive suits tell you.Should you watch it? If Marvel fan.. you already seen it. If you aren't marvel fan, but still enjoy sci-fi/fantasy... Eh... Not like there's anything better to do I guess.",12 September 2021

ulex_stovetop, Great Visually - Maybe I Missed Something,"This film is... good,... but a little disappointing.Let's start with the positives. This movie looks incredible. The Chinese elements and Asian-American influences give this film a wonderfully unique style. The fight choreography is some of the cleanest ever seen in the universe. It all looks incredible and clear, with clear lessons learned from the works of Bruce Lee. Simu Liu does an amazing job and I ADORE Shang-Chi and a character. I cannot wait to see more of him in the future.Unfortunately, the writing really lets this movie down in a lot of ways. None of the characters in the film feel like they learn or grow throughout the story, including Shang-Chi. Shang starts out as a trained fighter who loves his dad but condemns his actions and he finishes the film in the exact same spot. I similar thing can be said for his father who also feels very stagnant. Shang's sister is unbelievably one-dimensional filling in as the badass woman type with no further depth beyond her painful American accent. The comic relief characters very much overstay their welcome and become grating as things go on. This is very apparent for the return of Trevor who should have remained nothing more than a 10-second cameo.The story itself is very messy and cliche. At the beginning of the film, we are presented with an amulet that is treated as being very important but disappears at the end of the first act. Shang's journey isn't really motivated with himself, but through an urge to stop whatever his father is doing. It all feels very hallow.I appreciate what this movie will do for Asian representation, but am underwhelmed by it simply as a film on its own, not unlike that of Black Panther.",6 September 2021
Bek204," ""Is this what you wanted?""","Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings introduces a new Marvel Character/Avenger, and that's Shang-Chi. The way that the film introduced that character was great. Loved how the film jumps back and forth a few times to tell us about Shang-Chi's past when he was young and how or why he ended up where he is in the present day.The film had so many fight scenes that were amazing and the cinematography that was used to shoot these fight scenes made them 10x better and that's perhaps because the cinematographer of this film is Bill Pope who shot The Matrix (1999) and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (2004). You could tell for sure that there are a lot of similarities between the fight scenes in Shang-Chi and The Matrix especially that both of them had this ""kung fu"" style of fighting. Loved how sometimes during the fight scenes the ""Dutch tilt"" method was used and it was wide showing the stunning set design around.The film is also visually stunning which I'm happy to call one of Marvel's most visually stunning films. It's a treat for the eyes.The comedy in the film was so good and used very carefully in perfect times which is something that scares me whenever I watch a ""Marvel"" film. Because these films are supposed to be ""serious superhero"" films. But, when comedy is used in perfect times, the result will be perfect.Akwafina's acting was very great. Loved her character and am excited to see what her character will have in future MCU Films. Simu Liu was of course the perfect actor for this role but one thing that in my opinion he ""failed at"" are the ""emotional scenes"". This film has so many emotional scenes that discuss ""family"" and the relationship between a father and his son. I felt like Simu Liu couldn't be able to deliver that emotional feeling to the audience because his acting was bad in these emotional scenes. This brings me to Tony Chiu-Wai Leung who plays ""the father"". Leung carried the whole film in my opinion. Whenever there was an emotional scene between the father and his son, Leung was way better at expressing and showing his feelings than Simu Liu.Loved all the visual effects, they were all well made especially that the film has so many. The customs as well are great and loved how sometimes the colors represent Shang-Chi's culture like the ""football varsity jacket"" that was red and grey that Shang-Chi was wearing at the beginning of the film.I got to point out that the last 30 minutes or so of the film are one of the greatest and most enjoyable in the whole MCU.My rating is 8/10.",12 September 2021

Maybe that's a pointless exercise, since they're all very different (mostly).Whatever, this is well worth watching. The CGI is some of the best I've seen, and it actually blends pretty well with the live action (not always the case with other movies). The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed, in the Hong Kong style (with a nod to Jackie Chan in the first half). The creature battle at the end is a masterpiece of visual effects.The character development is fairly standard (father/son), but done do well it doesn't really matter. Simu Liu and Awkwafina are perfectly cast, and bring a well balanced comedic touch overall.Really very impressed. My faith in Marvel has been (partially) restored.",14 January 2022

Slarkshark, Welcome to the Club,"A very welcomed addition to the MCU, and any Avengers to come. 'Shang-Chi' kung-fu's it's way to top tier MCU territory, especially when it comes to origin stories.Perhaps this generations 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', both of which are visual spectacles to behold. 'Shang-Chi' is full of beautiful creatures, costumes, martial arts, and acting. Probably the best fighting in the MCU, which makes sense (though Cap and Winter Soldier fighting is my personal favourite). The real Mandarin makes his debut and does not disappoint, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung was fantastic. All the other cast members were very likable as well. A few appearances from other MCU characters, including a surprising one that somewhat redeems himself.A refreshing Marvel superhero movie in that it primarily focuses on itself, but has tons of potential to jump right in with other Marvel storylines. The MCU still holds lots of excitement for the future with characters like Shang-Chi.",6 September 2021
RogerBorg," Crouching Pander, Hidden Profit Margin","What do you get when you have no idea what you are creating beyond ""Rip off successful Cantonese Han movies, so that the Mouse can sell the product to Flu Bear""?Well, now we know. A painfully spavined production that begs Flu Bear to approve it right from the first subtitled moment with excruciatingly ""Mandarin"" performances that even a barely trained White ear can detect as being more Californian than Chongqing.Then the movie proper starts, and we're inflicted with Nora Lum, who has built her career on appropriating and exploiting Blackness. Wow. Nora Lum, in the current year.Granted, the Mandarin Empire loathes Black people even more than Nora Lum does, but it's still startling to see her not only accepted but showcased.Oh, the movie?Eh, who cares? It's all ropey CGI, overblown score, infantile plot, cringe dialogue, and a truly tragic performance by Michelle Yeo who I wish had had the integrity to turn down this opportunity.Final context: I wept three times during Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: once in joy, once in sadness, once in astonishment.I wept once during this... thing... in despair.

It's a villain whose motivation is actually both believable and relatable. Oh, and the actual ""Mandarin"" was also a comical gold.Plus, fighting scenes were absolutely amazing. First half's martial art scenes were on par with some martial arts classics and later half of, well, typical Marvel CGI stuff were quite of eye candies.Sure, there were few less developed character arcs like Shang-Chi's sister but overall, this is an excellent movie that won't disappoint you.",6 September 2021
sebastianschlicht, Good action is not enough: Shang-Chi and the Marvel-problem!,"With ""Endgame"", the MCU had its well-deserved success in 2019. But how should it continue after that? It was clear that Kevin Feige did not want to quit, of course. But unfortunately I have to say that no film or show after the ""Avengers"" spectacle has really convinced me so far. That's why I was hoping for ""Shang-Chi"" (2021), which should score points above all with spectacular action scenes (inspired by Asian cinema). But after watching the movie, I'm unfortunately anything but enthusiastic. ""Shang-Chi"" has great action here and there, but what about the rest?Shaun and his best friend Katy are searching for a meaning in their life when suddenly Shaun's father, a powerful mafia boss with magical rings in his possession, visits his son. The reason is that Shaun was trained to be a killer, but wanted a different life. Sadly his father cannot accept that ...I'll have to spoil small details, but in my opinion ""Shang-Chi"" is not a film that can really be spoiled because it is made like almost every other typical superhero film.First, let's get to the action, which has received so much critical acclaim. Yes, the choreographies are really impressive and beautiful to look at in the first two thirds. This is something that a lot of MCU movies don't do well, which is why I really appreciate the action here too. BUT when the finale is approaching, the action quickly subsides. Because here it unfortunately needed a big CGI battle festival with big creatures and apocalyptic events. This is exactly what was already dealt with critically in ""Civil War"", but Marvel keeps falling into this old superhero-cliché. For the ""Avengers""-films, that decision is perfectly fine (especially for ""Infinity War"" and ""Endgame""), but what about the stand alone films? Here you have to keep asking yourself: Where are the other Avengers? Where is Spider-Man, Doctor Strange or Captain Marvel?""Shang-Chi"" would have worked so much better if the finale had been a personal battle between Shaun and his dad. Instead, you need gigantic demons and CGI battles. Even the green screen work is not always good in my opinion and quickly looks artificial and fake. No matter what you think about the ""Matrix"" sequels, but the fight scenes there are so much more impressive to me because you often only used CGI when you needed it. Or let's watch Asian martial arts films with Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. There was hardly ever any computer trickery because most of these films were shot between the 60s and 80s. At the moment you can rather watch the ""John Wick""-films if you want to see spectacular and hand-made action. Because ""Shang-Chi"" unfortunately has little to offer apart from the action ...The story is the absolute run-of-the-mill cliché stuff, which is now rather parodied in many of these films. The classic outsider who has problems with his father and still has to learn a lot about himself, but is already so good that he could do it on his own easily. His girlfriend Katy is the necessary sidekick and knocks out the obvious jokes so that the viewer does not get too lost in the drama. Everything is so forced and unnatural that I was bored to death. And Marvel films in particular are supposed to be fun and entertaining. ""Shang-Chi"" wants to repeat the ""Black Panther"" success and shows a superhero who is not white, but in this case of Asian origin. And that's great and important, but in the end we mustn't forget that a film cannot be judged solely on the basis of its intentions. Even ""Black Panther"" was only average for many fans in the end, but it could offer a bit more interesting story elements for me.The MCU is currently suffering from a trivial ""mass taste"" identity. Everything that came after ""Endgame"" can be described in one word: Safe. ""Shang-Chi"" is also designed in such a way that as many people as possible can enjoy the film. It wants to be dark and ""cool"", but at the same time also child-friendly and funny.Another problem are the way too perfect protagonists of these new MCU works. They can often solve all of their problems within one film. At the end of the movie, for example, Shang-Chi has practically nothing that he can improve on. Tony Stark or Peter Parker had to fight and work on themselves in every film and often did not reach their goal by the end of the film. But that makes characters more exciting in many ways. In my opinion, the characters in ""Shang-Chi"" are too superficial with their problems. It may all be heartbreaking and violent on paper, but the execution doesn't seem anything but real. It's a typical movie that feels like a typical movie and sounds like a typical movie.The actors may not be the reason for all of this, but I didn't find any of the acting performances really convincing or interesting. Yes, lead actor Simu Liu is physically capable of doing these great stunts himself and I really appreciate that. But there has to be more when it comes to acting as well. And that applies to everyone in the cast, except maybe Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who plays Shaun's father. He does his job very well, after all he´s in the business for quite a while now. There's also a surprise guest from a previous Marvel movie (I won't name him or her separately), but I've rarely seen such a pointless character in a movie. This character is only there so that Marvel and Kevin Feige can say, ""Here's our fan service, baby!""Director Destin Daniel Cretton, who has already made a name for himself in the film business, certainly had the best intentions, as did his talented cameraman Bill Pope (who has already worked for the ""Matrix"" sequels or Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" films), but in the end Marvel and Disney seem to have too much say and want their product to be suitable for the masses. And if you're not a Scorsese or a Nolan, then it's not so easy to get your vision through.One last word to the composer Joel P West, who wrote a (sometimes) beautiful score with Asian influences. In the action, however, the whole thing quickly seems very unimaginative ...Conclusion: ""Shang-Chi"" has finally shown me that Marvel is slowly becoming trivial. It was almost clear that after ""Endgame"" practically nothing could really astonish us anymore, but there was still hope with me. But precisely this hope is crumbling right now. Great action alone is not enough for a film to convince me and ""Shng-Chi"" is the best proof.",19 November 2021
baquaman, Shang-Chi,"Great action sequences and visual effects throughout, likeable characters, especially Tony Leung as Wenwu. Definitely one of the best mcu villains.

silverlve," Shang-Chi brings on the action, heart and excitement","What a fun ride with some emotionally touching scenes. Tony Leung Chiu-wai worked hard at making his character a different kind of villain who is not stereotypical and the way he loses connection and wallows in grief is deep. You can see what is causing him to act as he does.Simu Liu carries this movie alongside Tony Leung and it's got a lot of father/son conflict which is touching to see on screen.The fight scenes are really good, the action is top notch and I liked the friendship running along in the story.

awessel-58117, One of the best films Marvel as ever made!,"This movie was fantastic! It did a great job of standing on its own while including little easter eggs from the rest of the MCU throughout the film. Simu and Awk killed their roles, and I can't wait to see more from them as these characters. The story was so compelling, and the theme of the movie was so unique and refreshing in an industry that usually white-washes Asian-lead films. I cannot stress enough how well they also executed the use of female roles to empower women to accomplish their goals. Katy and Xialing were along with Shang through the whole ride and played just as important of roles as he did. Lastly, the inclusion of Shang and Katy into the MCU longterm is such a good move on the part of Marvel. I am so ready for what's to come after that end credit scene, including the last one about The Ten Rings ;). 9/10 from me, Marvel is still out here killing the game. People who hate on this movie don't understand good cinema.",3 September 2021
Ynocrozplatfom, At least it looks stunning,"A movie with clear and crisp visuals that blends Chinese Kung Fu with CGI to perfection, but this seems to come at a cost of a weak and underdeveloped plot with misplaced priorities that prevents the audience from investing into the characters.",10 September 2021
PedroPires90, Good,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.",8 September 2021
nidhunmoviebuff, Another fabulous addition to MCU's Phase 4!,"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong CinemaThe flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.Highly recommended. A must watch. Marvel's Phase 4 continues to raise the bar!",4 September 2021
magicmuffinman12, Meh.,Akwafinas character was extremely annoying and not funny at all with forced cringy humor which ruined the movie. The fact she picked up a bow and arrow for this first time in her life and helped saved the day was ridiculous.The visuals were nice though and the fight scenes were nicely choreographed.Lack of character of shang chi not that the acting was bad but he don't have a strong personality and there isn't anything interesting about him really.The story was kinda of boring and the plot was kinda stupid.,8 October 2021

And if this is the best of Marvels Phase 4, I generally think Marvel must have peaked in Phase 3 with the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy.Normally the 'first of movie' has a decent back/origin story, but this film just felt weak on all levels. None of the acting was bad, but I found myself not caring about any of the characters.The whole film felt totally disjointed by been told in far too many flash back scenes. Numerous times during the movie, someone explains to someone else why something is happening, (so the audience might have some clue as to what is happening), which normally follows yet another flashback.I have thoroughly enjoyed most of the Marvel movies, but this one is just so forgettable.",5 December 2021

dan_slentz, Excellent Movie.. Stands on it's own without seeing any others.,"""Reel Tunez: The Radio Show All About the Movies"" Movie Review (9/8/21): ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings""First, when people on IMDB rate a movie (though VERY good) a 9 or 10, I really want to ask ""So it's a 10.. the VERY BEST movie EVER.. as good as ""Sound of Music"", ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Oliver"", ""Star Wars"" and movies that probably DO get a 9 or 10?? To me.. YES.. an excellent movie. But people skew the ratings by calling everything a 9 or 10. With that said, I'd give it between a 7 and 8 (which is VERY good), but a little closer to a 7 (7.4).Yet another Marvel Studio (Disney) release to the Marvel Universe. I knew nothing about this movie and didn't really have a lot of interest in seeing it, but GLAD I did! It was fun.. and it was exciting! Excellent adventure movie that had great effects and great story line.If you like adventure movies.. even if you haven't followed the Marvel Universe, you really don't have to know the history of the other movies to enjoy this one.I will add the following (which is not a spoiler): Do NOT leave the movie until the very VERY last of the credits have rolled and they turn on the lights to clean the place. As the movie ends, we go into one last restaurant scene. Then in the middle of the credits, we get MORE story. Then after the last of the credits.. even after ""Marvel Studio Cleaning Crew: Bob the Janitor and Mae his wife"", we get ONE more scene at the end. These Marvel extras are consistent and basically a clue into what comes next.On a 1-10 scaled, I'd give this a very good 7.4! This is a BIG screen movie, so see it at the theater.",9 September 2021

gabrielgarbagni, A Marvelous Ride,"At first glance, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is emotional, engaging and action packed. The truth is that there's so much more behind the surface. It is a story of self discovery, full of great character arcs, glorious fight scenes and dynamic choreography. Simu Liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him. The director, Destin Daniel Cretton, manages to create a new mythology, both inspired by the comics and the Chinese tradition. The visual effects are great, even outstanding during certain moments, as well as the concept design of all the mythical creatures. Finally, the music really meshes amazingly with the scenes, especially when there's more action and emotion. A new modern superhero has arrived and he's ready to deliver some punches. This movie really pulls off a great origin story that proves, once again, the endless possibilities the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to offer.",4 September 2021

DezmoTheMovieMan, Marvel got this one right!,"Shang-Chi is one of those movies that starts off strong and never stops entertaining you. From the beginning, I felt connected to the characters and the story made sense.Shang-Chi had just the right amount of funny comments or jokes that you can still take it seriously, and at the right time, everyone was serious. I must admit, I had my doubts about Awkwafina when I saw her as the role of Katy, I was afraid she would crack jokes the entire move, but that's not the case. When the time was right, there was a joke, when the time came to be serious, she displayed her strong acting skills and carried her role perfectly.Simu Liu was nothing short of perfection for me from start to finish, but to be honest, that's what I expected.Both Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Fala Chen were incredible as well as the rest of the cast. Everyone played their part and played it well.I feel like the movie was a great story and we took a great ride alongside the ten rings, their origin and progression of power. The father was a villain, but he had his reasons and was made to feel human.I have no bad comments regarding this movie other than I don't want to wait a whole year to see part II.",16 November 2021

hypestyle, Easily the best Superhero Film of 2021,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the latest comic-book inspired action-fantasy film from Marvel-Disney Studios. Daniel Destin Crettin is the director.The film stars Simu Liu (Canadian television's ""Kim's Convenience"") as the title character. Known as Shaun in the beginning of the narrative, he's a late-20-something who works as a valet at a San Francisco hotel with his carefree best friend Katy (Nora ""Awkwafina"" Lum). Seemingly okay with eking by earning a working-class living, Shaun's life changes when he receives a mysterious postcard. The next day a group of hitmen attack him on a bus, forcing him to reveal his potent martial arts prowess.Turns out, ""Shaun"" was born to Wenwu (veteran Chinese cinema star Tony Leung), a crime boss in China whose career has literally lasted centuries, thanks to a mysterious set of rings worn around his lower arms that grant magic powers-- including, apparently, immortality. Shang Chi's mother Ying Li (Fala Chen) was a resident of a mysterious, magical Chinese city-- think Shangri-La or Black Panther's Wakanda. Possessing her own magic-inspired martial arts skills, she convinced Wenwu to temporarily leave behind his crime empire and start a family. It didn't last, leading to a family tragedy and Shang's self-imposed exile in America.The plot has to do with Wenwu's insistence on bringing Shang and his sister Xialing (Menger Zhang) back into the family fold, so they can collectively find the entrance to the mystic city, conquer the inhabitants and reunite with Ying Li, who Wenwu insists whispers to him from beyond the grave. Shang and Xialing want nothing to do with their father's criminal empire, but Wenwu is not above brutality to convince cooperation.The film takes dramatic liberties with the original source material. Part of this is legally necessary, as the comic book Shang Chi's father was originally Yellow Peril villain Fu Manchu-- officially owned by the Sax Rohmer estate. Additionally, the original comics posed Shang as an agent of Great Britain's MI-6, with a mostly British supporting cast, including someone who ""playfully"" would refer to Shang as (an ethnic slur for Chinese/Asians). All of that backdrop is wisely eschewed for an all new set of allies and adversaries. Katy provides comic relief and as a low-key audience stand-in. As a 2nd-generation child of immigrants she also highlights the vantage point of someone who is very ""Americanized"" who bristles at ""old school values and customs"" of her parents/grandparents but striggles to fulfill her own pathway in life.Simu Liu gives a solid journeyman's performance as Shang Chi. He handles the action as well as the dramatic and comedic components. Still, it's something of a role that's semi-mired in exposition, because viewers mainly get to see his younger life in flashbacks.The action is well choreographed, including ballet-like scenes of combat and courtship alike, with nods to fantasy physics but never egregiously outlandish. The film also has beautiful cinematography courtesy of Bill Pope (his cinematography credits include 'The Matrix' and the first three 'Spider-Man' films).Possibly the most fully realized performance is that of Tony Leung, who gets to portray a more in-depth villain than is typically featured in most comic book movies. There are other solid supporting roles played by Michelle Yeoh and Sir Ben Kingsley.The climax of the film is filled with special-effects-based wonders including creatures of all sorts and Mulan-style fights between army legions. This can get dizzying for the non-comics-steeped layperson, so this may be overwhelming for some viewers. But the overall narrative is satisfying.The film takes place independent of any particular goings-in in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it is only a post-credits coda that links it to the greater Marvel pantheon. This film can be enjoyed by itself without watching any of the ""Avengers"" franchises.It remains to be seen whether ""Legend of the Ten Rings"" makes the Shang Chi character a household name alongside Captain America, Iron Man and the Rest but it is more than a worthy entry to the current phase of the Marvel movie saga.",6 September 2021
4llenaa, an amazing story,I just finished watching this and all i can say is this movie is soo unique. From the action to the atmosphere it just made this experience so great words can't even explain. I'm so eager to see what marvel has in store for us next!,3 September 2021
kitingaomotoso, AMAZING🔥🔥🔥,I have already watch this movie three times this movie was awesome. It had everything from action to comedy and the really embraced the Chinese culture in this movie. But I was more excited for the post credit scene and I think we have not seen the last of shang chi.,3 September 2021
statuskuo, There's Dragon Fights!,"What more do you want?I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""",4 September 2021
mr_bickle_the_pickle, Shang Chi kicks ass,"Ok, so I really liked it. In particular I really liked the characters. I loved the hero's journey that Shang Chi went on. I loved his relationship with Katy and his sister. They were all likable, and badass in their own way. And you could empathize with them. I thought this was a very strong villain. Not just physically, but very compelling. A lot of MCU villains can come across as very one note. But he was complex and layered. So that was great to see. And of course they were all strongly acted as well. Akwafina is maybe the least strongest out of the main cast (Check out The Farewell if you really want to see her shine) but like, she is still is good in this.I loved the fight choreography in this. Probably some of the best fight scenes you get in the MCU. And I loved the visuals used in those scenes as well. Some shots were truly stunning to watch.One downside I had though is that I wanted to know more about how the magic works. Like the final battle between Shang Chi and his father he has suddenly mastered his mother's magic/fighting. And I know the movie kind of pokes fun of this at the end by having Shang Chi tell his friends that he had 1 day of training. But seriously, how did that happen? Is it just because he's his mother's son? Is it because he was specifically in that place? I just needed a little more backstory/explanation. Also, the Wong/Abomination fight (which was totally spoiled in the trailers) didnt really do anything and just added more questions. I guess they needed a way to set up Wong for the mid credits scene though. And that mid credits scene in general just raised more questions for me. Like why is Bruce back to being in his human form? It clearly takes place after the events of Endgame (judging by his arm sling) so why is he not in his Professor Hulk form?I thought the comedy was good for the most part. I think it worked well with the beginning and ending of the film. But didnt always land during the more meatier parts of the film. Theres maybe a few other elements I could nitpick but for the most part I really liked this film. Im not sure where I would rank it yet. I think probably a top 10-er.",3 September 2021
ericstevenson, Mandarin's also a language,"This movie features the lesser known Marvel superhero Shang-Chi, who's a former assassin from China hiding out in the USA. He goes back to China when assassins come after him, who are also after his sister. It turns out his father is the real Mandarin who sadly doesn't get to meet Iron Man. His impersonator from ""Iron Man 3"", played by Ben Kingsley is there and is a lot of fun. It's a nice throwback to the older Marvel films and a good way to satisfy the fans. I like how there's two people of the same gender who are not love interests.We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It's still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie. I recall an interview when the actor said a lot of Chinese people are called Bruce Lee. That makes the documentary ""The Problem With Apu"" even more idiotic. ***1/2.",18 October 2021
rick-jatti, a gorgeous movie,"Shang-Chi has instantly entered my top 5 of Marvel movies. There is so much to adore about this movie. The visuals are beautiful, the villain is compelling, the last sequence isn't very predictable, as superhero movies can often be. The characters all have a level of depth that is often missing from the supporting characters in superhero movies, and I was pleased that they didn't marginalize Xialing as it would've been easy to do. I don't know much about the different disciplines of martial arts, but it seems very similar to Avatar: The Last Airbender in how they drew inspiration from different real world fighting styles for different fighters in the movie. If I compare the acting to the other movies I consider the best to produced by Marvel (Infinity War, Ragnarok, Winter Soldier, etc.), Shang-Chi is a notch below, but it blows every other Marvel movie out of the water when it comes to action and choreography. The bus scene in the first act has easily become my favorite sequence in any Marvel film. Origin films often fall into the same traps, but Shang-Chi doesn't, maybe because many didn't know much about the character. But even so, typical tropes like training sequences were done better in Shang-Chi, and the story didn't linger on his youth too much.",9 September 2021

pompey2310, Cheesy pulp for 12 year olds,Have I missed something? All these glowing reviews but I found this rather clichéd and the script lacking in any originality. It starts off watchable but descends into a sluggish tiresome holed plot line. Lots of lazy writing with one dimensional characters. The action is credible at the start (bus scene) but then becomes stupid and just CGI nonsense. Such a shame as this had huge potential at the start but quickly became rather childish and unentertaining.,16 November 2021

questl-18592, Shang-Chi and NOT the Ten Rings -_-,"As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it. Black Widow was a meh experience and now Shang-Chi feels like more of that rote, by the numbers repetitiveness. Yes, they add a lot of Asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and I appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance. Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!",21 January 2022
mdlong82, I wished for so much more,"This could have been a great movie, but it wasn't. It began well and ended well. Everything in between was pretty lame. Disney has the Disney plus platform where they could have built up this character since no one really knows who shang chi is. Unfortunately, Disney didn't do that so most of the minute I'm just left wondering why do I care. With so much Asian culture to pull from I wish Disney would have done more. 3 out of 10 stars. Other reviews I'm sure are paid for.",4 September 2021

dochands, Disappointing. A lot of exposition. Not much sense. And why is there an Awkafina?,This was one of those movies where they tried to recreate better and seemed to think that throwing in every possible cliche and special effect would do it. I have found several films I wanted to enjoy ruined by the performance of Awkafina. She and Timothy Chalamet seem to populate another alternative universe where they are considered star power. But even with her presence I don't think I could like this movie. Nothing new here except an Asian theme.,12 November 2021

nvmensah, Great Marvel movie with GREAT CGI sequences!,"I'm not gonna to lie, I wasn't excited for this movie. The first teaser was underwhelming and the official trailer didn't get me hooked either. Either way I'm a huge MCU and Marvel fan so I decided to go watch it either way. IT WAS AMAZING. The film was only 2+ hours but it contained soo much, the setting changed so much. The actors did a great job, the cinematography was great and CGI was spot on. The only complaint is that the movie felt very cringe ish at some times, especially during the first 10 minutes. But the movie gradually got better, still having some cringey scenes during the run. I know some people have their complaints on Awkwafina but she really did a great job. Simu Liu's character was lacking at times though but I'd definitely say he has one of the best debut characters in terms of personality.*And why people are reviewing this now is because it was released on September 1th in a few countries.Also spoiler, Abomination's character only did a very brief appearance, it was so brief so that I was unable to even film him.Also, we have another bad guy who will show up later in the MCU ;)",1 September 2021
Pjtaylor-96-138044, The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.",14 November 2021
giamustaine, Did they really spend money in this movie?,"Frankly, terrible movie. Forced jokes, the storyline was weak, the antagonist who was hundred years old was even weaker, I could go on and on.If they thought that including acrobatics in the action scenes was going to make this movie better, well, let me tell you I've seen lots better in low budget martial arts films.A waste of time and money. A movie marvel that doesn't feel marvel. Yes I regret investing time and money to watch this movie. Marvel can I have my money back?",14 November 2021
sbweightman, An Asian Marvel Origin story with all the spectacle you've come to expect.,"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting
The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better.",4 September 2021
casualmovienerd, Martin Scorsese Was So Right,"Martin Scorsese called most of these generic MCU movies theme park movies and This movie is perfect example of that.

stkim-61523, Wow!,I honestly had no expectations watching this movie because I've never heard of Shang-Chi in any of the Marvel Comics.Definitely surprisingly fun to watch. Action packed! Definitely recommended!,21 December 2021
PotassiumMan, Great superhero entertainment with a classic storyline,"The charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters, showing a reflection of today's world, where Asian culture and the way of life in the west creates an environment of searching for one's own identity and place - this is where we meet Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) first. A young adult trying to navigate through his life far away from his family in the city of San Francisco. His partner in crime is his best female friend Katy (Awkwafina).Simu Liu's character arc in this film is not significant. Although he makes
a solid protagonist, his own character development is de minimis. Awkwafina, by contrast, steals the film as the ordinary person caught up in the epic power struggle. Her trademark zingers and bemused quips make her the perfect foil against the escapist superhero world that she- and we as the audience- are thrust into. Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) is a subtly effective Marvel villain with a compelling family backstory; he is a cinematic antagonist with the most idealism and righteous sense of purpose since Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"".Michelle Yeoh as Shang-Chi's aunt Jiang Nan has again some great fighting scenes which stand up to her wonderful performance in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Overall this movie has great fighting scenes, extraordinary effects, especially the flying dragons which are delightful to watch. Highly recommended for everyone who likes superheroes and a touch of mysterious fairytales.",6 September 2021
steven_wallery, Haters suck They're a plague,This movie was awesome. Any haters are simply doing it to disagree and be a loud voice.

terrylarosa, An amazing entertaining movie,"Wow was this fun. Charismatic Simu hits a home run/touchdown with this movie. Even Akwafina becomes likable by the halfway point and that's saying a lot. Unlike recent martial arts movies like Black Widow or Snake Eyes you actually see the punches and kicks. Even the wire fu looks elegant instead of ridiculous. Something very few movies have pulled off. Funny, fun and never boring despite quite a bit of exposition and the final CGI extravaganza battle is a sight to behold. Fantastic battle between the Chineese dragon and the malevolent creature. After seeing 5 disappointing back to back superhero movies:
Far from Home

rgkarim," Not Quite a Ten, But Very Good Ring to Add To the Collection","LikesGreat Pacing:
Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.Character Development:
The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.The Surprise Cameo:
Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.The Cultural Influence:
Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.The CGI
Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.The Acting:
A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.The Comedy:
Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.The Action:
My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.A Bit More Adult:
The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.Some of the political moments:
While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.A Little More Action:The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.The VERDICT:Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5
Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.",3 September 2021

Anurag-Shetty, Marvel gives us another unique & unforgettable superhero.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings tells the story of Shaun/Shang-Chi(Simu Liu). Shang-Chi is an expert of Kung Fu. He is forced to deal with his past, when he's pursued by the Ten Rings organization.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a mind-blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe strikes gold yet again & can do no wrong! Director Destin Daniel Cretton has given us one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best origin stories. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. It's awesome to finally see the Kung Fu fighting style, utilized in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. Simu Liu is spectacular as Shaun/Shang-Chi. Liu easily balances the action, dramatic scenes & the Marvel Cinematic Universe's trademark humor. Can't wait to see more of him in the future. Awkwafina is hysterical as Katy. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is outstanding as Xu Wenwu. Meng'er Zhang is fantastic as Xialing. Fala Chen is brilliant as Li. Michelle Yeoh is excellent as Ying Nan. Florian Munteanu is superb as Razor Fist. The supporting cast is amazing. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans & superhero film buffs.

jpachar82, A New Kind of Hero,"What do you call a man on a mission to keep his family safe? What do you call a man who just wants to fit in where he belongs? A new kind of hero. We have entered into Phase 4 of the greatest movie franchise in movie history. We have seen battles, we have seen so many Marvel characters in the last 12 years come to life, but this new kind of hero comes to us by surprise.Who here knows about Shang-Chi? I just learned about on Friday and from what I read - I can honestly tell you his story is one for the history books. I can't give out the whole movie to you or anything to spoil the movie, but this movie was different from the other movies in the MCU.I was in shock from the very beginning to the end, there were a lot of ""easter eggs"" linking all the way back to Tony Stark, oops, I think I said a little too much, but I will say this -
This movie defied everything in the natural and supernatural realm of not only the physical, but the soul. It dives deep into the soul of a person, and that is what Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is all about.I have to give a huge shout-out to Simu Liu - like I said before - I have never heard of Shang-Chi up until recently, but he gave the role a new meaning and a new identity.Now without giving too much away, with every Marvel movie, there are some credit scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. That's all I am saying.So in essence - I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: 11 stars.",5 September 2021
chloeurc, Loved it,"Shang Chi movie review-
Some spoilers
Pros:
The story. I thought this movie would be boring just because it's a character that I am completely unfamiliar with but it actually was very interesting. Not just the plot but the origin and the backstory on peoples lives, I really loved the idea of it all. It incorporated a lot of cool Asian culture as well as some hip-hop American vibes and culture too. It was a very awesome combination.The characters you don't see in the trailer. One of the main characters is Shang-Chi's sister, the girl with the short hair and bangs (left in picture). She is by far the coolest character in this entire movie and I don't know WHY she is not on the front of more posters and more trailers! Katy played by Awkwafina isn't just the person in the movie that's the comedy, there are others too and although she is funny she actually has a lot more depth to her character and does have some serious moments, she's in the whole movie. I liked her more than I thought I would.The fight scenes and action. Shang Chi (Shaun) is extremely skilled in Kung Fu and actually has a fighting style similar to Batman. If he had a cape it would be awesome, but I know his character doesn't need it. There are very cool scenes that reminded me of scenes in Wakanda but in a mystical Asian land where there are dragons and other cool fictional creatures. The sets are beautiful!Some cameos and also the music. I won't spoil anything but there are some pretty cool cameos in this movie that definitely set up the world of the Marvel universe. Although the one cameo we'd all love to see we cannot. RIP Stan Lee. This film actually had some really cool music, the main character actually sings a song or two on the soundtrack as well as some really cool hip-hop music. I suggest to go check it out!Cons:Some plot holes. There were some moments were I got confused with some of the details of the plot. There were things that were not answered you have to figure out on your own. It's good to go to the movies with people so that you can talk about it afterwards and catch things. It is one of those movies where you may have to see it again to catch some things that you missed. I wish they made it a little bit more clear.The weird friendship between Katy and Shaun. In the movie you see that the two leads are BEST friends, they work together. But in the real world that is not very realistic. They kind of hint that there may be something that comes of it, some moments where I totally thought it was going to be romantic. I just wish they would either make it romantic or not, not somewhere in between. I'm sure there will be more movies where they may make them a couple eventually.The Mandarin. For those of you who don't know, that is the father of Shang Chi and Xialing (the real one not the drunk one on Iron Man 3). He is a very tough man, a villain. I don't like the aspect of making his father the villain even though that's the way I'm sure it is in the comic books. It just seems sad and not a good story that his dad sucks. I wish Marvel had some more Mufasas.All in all though it was great! Stay for all the credits there's two! It was better than I thought.8/10.",8 September 2021

boris_unanimate," Wow, just wow!","Before seeing this movie, I had zero expectations, went in blind, and it became one of the best Marvel movies I've seen in a long time. It's very well written, which is uncommon in Disney/Marvel movies; it's well directed and the actors all did a fantastic job. Every single actor was good, and none made me cringe, as plenty of MCU characters usually do because they're written by bad writers.I'm not a fan of Awkwafina, but she was wonderful, and I actually felt emotional connections to characters. The runtime was ideal, and the entire production design was incredible, as was the CGI, which made this into an epic martial arts experience. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish because it's not a regular Marvel/superhero flick, it's a real adventure. One of the few MCU movies I might rewatch once or twice.Very recommendable.",20 November 2021

frostzzz, This movie made me feel like a grumpy old man. And here's why.,"MCU now is in a very strange phase when the universe they've built now is so huge that their movies almost completely stopped working as standalone pieces (aside for a few exceptions like Thor 3).Shang-Chi brings Asian aesthetics to the table which is kinda new for the universe. And it's done quite well. They've managed to present a whole new world inside the one we've already had at this point throughout this one short movie. They've packed it with alright characters, adventures and action. So as a piece of the bigger narrative this movie is quite well made.But to me it falls short as a standalone picture. It feels so formulaic at this point that it hurts sometimes. All the twists are obvious from miles ahead. The threat of ""the end of the world"" is so regular at this point that it's impossible to be invested in it and the stakes don't feel significant at all.And I hate the fact that even a well made movie like this one leaves you feeling empty after watching. It doesn't bring a feeling of completion which I think is one of the most important parts of cinema. Even Wong tells something along these lines in the end: ""It was only a beginning, now you have a very long journey ahead of you"".I'm for one kinda tired of this never ending journey. And almost want to stop watching anything new from the MCU, so that I don't feel this never ending cliffhanger moment ever again.Light 7/10 to this movie, big donkey ass/10 to the MCU.",28 November 2021

hariharanakashlaxman, It's not enough?? Hell No.,"First marvel film with an asian lead are you ready hell yeah. First seeing the trailer thought it will be a good film but turns out i love it to the core. This film has all the elements humor, fighting, acting all done right. The main thing that attracts me is that the movie didn't waste a single minute in any other things. Fully focused on the plot and nothing else. Things got me wow is fight between wong and abomination and after the fight discussion between them and also the fighting choreography and cinematography were too good that i can't take my eyes of for a second. And most of all it's not the kind of the other family stories it different in many way. So that's it enjoy the movie see it in theaters if you have a chance. Stay safe....And don't miss the post credits there is real surprise waiting.",3 September 2021

Unfortunately much of that excitement was lost halfway through.It started to become overly cheesy, and I don't know why! And the special effects, as much as some of it was beautiful, got to be quite cartoony instead of realistic.The 2 credit scenes were brilliant, and Awkwafina stole the movie for me (she was fantastic!)...but aside from that I would say not the best Marvel offering.I'm actually glad that I waited and didn't waste money to see this at the cinema.

fredschaefer-406-623204, The next phase of the MCU is off to a great start.,"The first film in the MCU's next phase was BLACK WIDOW, but that film, which featured Scarlet Johannson's swan song as the title character, felt very much like it was grounded in what had come before, but SHANG-CHI: THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS very much breaks new ground, and takes us into a heretofore only hinted at corner of the Marvel Universe. It's the origin story of the title character, a martial arts superhero, but he is not nearly as well known as Spider-Man or Captain America, so we are not treated to yet another iteration of Uncle Ben's demise. Instead we are given a fleshed out story of a tragic family, one without easily defined villains. Shang-Chi joined the Marvel Comic scene in 1973 in an attempt to create a character that could cash in on the Kung Fu craze at the height of Bruce Lee's popularity. He had his own book for many years, interacting with other Marvel heroes, and if he has not been a Marvel regular in recent decades, Shang-Chi has never gone away, and retained the loyalty of many hardcore fans.Like all origin movies, SHANG-CHI begins with some exposition and back story, specifically concerning his father, Wenwu, played by Tone Leung, a power hungry thousand year old immortal, who wields the Ten Rings of the title, a fearsome mystical weapon of an unknown source. Only when he meets Li, played by Fala Chen, a fighter from the hidden realm of Ta-Lo, does he find someone who is his equal in combat. Falling in love, Wenwu forsakes his violent ways, and starts a family with Li. But in every hero's origin story there must be a tragedy, and when Li is murdered by Wenwu's rivals, he seeks vengeance, becoming the villain he once was, and teaching his son and daughter how to become deadly assassins. When we meet Shang-Chi, well played by Simu Liu, he is a twenty something Chinese immigrant living in San Francisco making a living as a parking valet with his best friend/girlfriend, Katy, played by Awkwafina, having broken from his father's world. But as with most stories centering on estranged families, the plot turns on them being drawn back together, and Wenwu needs a pair of pendants belonging to Shang-Chi and his sister that were gifts from their mother because they are essential, he believes, if he is to free his deceased spouse from the Dark Realm, whose entrance lies inside Ta-Lo. And if Shang-Chi doesn't want to go along with Dad's plan, too bad. It all comes to a head in an epic battle in Ta-Lo in a CGI heavy third act - pretty much a staple for the MCU.I liked this movie because it has plenty of energy, with great well done action scenes, along with some spectacularly staged martial arts battles. It also has a lot of heart, with characters who are easy to become invested in. And this lighter touch is welcome after the dark turns of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. In Tony Leung, it has a great villain with an understandable motive, something essential with any good super hero film. Simu Liu is an appealing lead, and he's matched all the way by Awkwafina's Katy, an underachiever who discovers special skills. I am not always impressed with CGI laden film making, but I don't mind it here because I actually care about the all too human characters involved in the action. The finale in Ta-Lo is supposed to be the high point of the movie, but for me, nothing beats the battle on the careening city bus on the streets of San Francisco early in the film, where Shang-Chi first shows his true martial arts prowess against his father's minions, led by the fearsome Razor Fist, played by the physically impressive Florian Monteneau. Michelle Yeoh has a part as a village elder, and out of nowhere, Ben Kingsley returns as actor Trevor Slattery, thus redeeming what for many of us fans what was one of the more disappointing villain tweaks from IRON MAN 3.An early scene at a Hong Kong fight club firmly establishes that all this is happening in the MCU with appearances by Benedict Wong's character from DOCTOR STRANGE, and the Abomination from THE HULK. Wong returns in a post credits scene that clearly sets up Shang-Chi and Katy for the big leagues in the next phase of the MCU. Will they learn where the Ten Rings came from, and maybe does THE ETERNALS have anything to do with it? And there is the dangling plot thread of what exactly happened when Shang-Chi was sent to kill the man responsible for his mother's death when he was 14; it was the event that estranged him from his father. Something tells me we will find out in some future installment. I can hardly wait.",5 September 2021
sweidman-28016, Refreshing and Captivating!,"""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.""Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!",8 September 2021

robfollower, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings(2021),"Bringing martial arts into this franchise is well.... a breath of fresh air from Marvel. Showcasing a series of excellent action sequences. There are some very intelligent minds be hide this origin story fantasy sci-fi feature. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best MCU films. Pro-tip, at some point in your lives seek this gem out ! This is going to be very solid UHD HDR blu-ray and the 3D is very impressive albeit some minor cross-talk but forgivable as the are some very intricate set pieces for the left and right eye to navigate via the post conversion 3D. Very well done over all.The visuals were absolutely stunning, comedic relief was always on point, fight sequences were sleek yet powerful. The story arch is well paced and unfolds gradually so one can get emotionally involved with the films characters , the acting is superb on all fronts from the films talented ensemble . The directing and pacing is spot on.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and one of my favorite entries as a whole.

tilmonhocutt, Completely different from the comic.,"While it was a good movie it had very little to do with Shang Chi Master of Kung Fu from the comics. Outside of the name Shang Chi, his father being evil and one of the villains Razorfist the movie was completely different from the comic character. In the comics his father is Fu Manchu. He does NOT have the 10 rings, the Mandrian does though they are actually finger sized rings. Razorfist has a normal blade in place of his hand not a bloody light saber. Fu Manchu does have an extended life but it it due to a serum he takes. I don't remember Shang Chi having a sister in the 100+ comics I read. At one point he did have an identical twin or maybe it was a clone. So again it WAS a good movie it just ruined it for me that they completely changed the story from the comics.",18 November 2021

Thanos_Alfie, Masterpiece...,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel.",1 October 2021

nancyldraper, Perfect,"Honestly, on all levels this movie excels! The casting is perfect. The world building is creative, beautiful and faithful to its Asian roots. The CGI and location shoots are breathtaking. The fighting is the best I've ever seen and even the training ground sequences have an exquisite grace. The action was balanced by heart. I was concerned Awkwafina would take the humour to campy lows but she truly showed she has some serious dramatic chops. She was not the comic relief! They gave that honour to the Shakespearean stage giant, Ben Kingsley, Our own, homegrown 🇨🇦 Simu Liu was perfect for the part and his performance was world class. I could go on raving but I'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a MCU solo representation of Asian culture as BLACK PANTHER was for African culture. I gathered some feedback as I left the theatre, and got ratings of 7.5 (felt it needed more MCU content), 8 (saw many of the things I have just commented on). I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design. Upon leaving the cinema, I was going to give the movie a 9 (superb) out of 10, but after reflecting on it, I don't know what they could have done to make it better, so, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",3 September 2021
sentient-74528, More of the same,"Kind of boring film. The premise is interesting, but kind of comedic all over and with little compromise with being convincing. I mean, Marvel films have this requirement for suspension of disbelief by default, but this film kind of explains very little and the character's interaction is shallow and not very meaningful. The end is predictable, everything looks artificial.Perhaps we are all vaccinated against Marvel's all over the place magic to a point that everything looks familiar, boring and flat. Or perhaps the film is just not that great.My big problem with this film is the bus sequence at the start. It eeps going downhill. I mean.. if you can make turns with the bus, why does it keep going down all the time? Turn left twice, it will go uphill instead of downhill and decelerate, then turn to any side and it should come to a standstill. Not very clever, guys.",25 September 2021

VVirak, Hate complimenting Disney,"... but this is a hit. They somehow succeeded expanding the vast MCU without really forcing it (it goes to show you the richness of American pocket and world culture can go a long way). This is a solid movie, with great action sequences and CGI that delivers. Mind you, SHANG-CHI is not the same without the mesmerizing Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh (when he doesn't fight, the title character is just OK and Awkwafina still isn't funny). Do not wait to watch it on TV because you should experience it at cinema first.UPDATE: This movie is NOT aging well -- I removed one star, but Awkwafina's character says 6 might not be low enough.",8 September 2021
wyvije, Instantly Bonafide MCU Smash,"A great mix of action, levity, and family drama (who can't relate to that?) not seen since Captain Marvel (a cat hacking a tesseract hairball ... again who can't relate).It is a visual masterpiece with elements any fan of The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild will swoon over (maybe not something everyone can relate to).If the 10 Rings ""ring"" a bell ... check out Iron Man 3 for a refresher.Also make sure to hang around for mid- and end-credit scenes.",8 September 2021
ignatgavrilovgavrilov, Everyone else -,"The restless father Wenwu (Tony Leung Chu Wai), the beautiful mother Jiang Li (Chen Fala) and the tough sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) - were members of the same ordinary family that has experienced both the best and the worst of times. I don't remember Disney and Marvel having a similar family history, and I'll be careful not to disassemble it so as not to accidentally spoil it. We have seen different fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters over the years, and the relationship between many was special. In the case of the Shang-Chi family, the writers found some interesting solutions in the style of Asian ""fathers and sons"". And in general, the leitmotif in the film is the theme of the family, albeit against the backdrop of flying arrows, bo, sai daggers and swords. Incredibly beautifully filmed several romantic scenes that serve to some extent justify the motives of the actions of the main protagonist. And the idea that a mother and father coexist equally in a child, although not new, makes one wonder how many facets and nuances we all consist of.",19 January 2022
bmynars," Marvel, what did I just watch???","I gave it 5 stars but I think it is still too generous. It has become very obvious that a shift took place in Marvel universe that no longer promotes pure American but rather it panders now to various multi letter groups as well as its new master: China.If I did know any better, I would think that this movie was made in Hong Kong (minus visual effects). I don't know who they made this movie for but I am sure it is not the American viewer. I come to think about it, it seems to me more and more it was made to pander Chinese market....",12 November 2021

justinns-28568, So glad this did well,"Where to start, I'll start by saying the choreography is the best in any movie ever made, easily, the cinematography and colouring is also effing fantastic, Simu pulled off a fantastic performance of amazing martial arts, a goofy dude who wasn't annoying, and pulled off emotional scenes very well, CGI was fantastic, the motivations for the plot were as well, I don't think it's perfect because there were some pacing issues, I felt a little bored in the third act for some reason, maybe it was a result of being tired to be honest so that's not they're fault. Great movie.TINY TINY SPOILER ABOUT POST CREDIT SCENES
But I did leave with a bad taste in my mouth because the critics said the post credit scenes were endgame level hype and I was so excited, expected Tobey and/or Andrew, or some x-men, spoiler alert, not even close, wasn't that good. So that is not the movies fault, just lower your credit scene expectations if you're freaking out about it.",7 September 2021
cinefileddd, Easily the most interesting and fresh marvel movie in a while,"Watch it it's very good.

eddie_baggins, A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.Final Say -Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.4 chicken-pigs out of 5.",20 September 2021

bastomacagic, The worst marvel movie... but beautiful effects and fights,"The movie starts good...but...soon begins the flashbacks and the nosense humour and anti-climax scenes. And then the ""mandarin""....
Seriously, this shang chi movie is the worst marvel movie of all. Its sad because the pricipal actor does his job well, but all the other characters are bad to the bone.",5 September 2021
cornerofspace, A very good action flick before it was overtaken by CGI.,"The action is the movie's biggest selling point. The hand to hand combat is done exceptionally well and the use of the environment and camera movement added to the flow and intensity of each scene.Character development and interactions is also fine. The only criticism I have is how the final fight got a bit too CGI-heavy. It really didn't need the super fantastical elements and definitely took away the character development the story was building up to. It kind of just felt like the higher-ups said a Marvel movie needs something grandiose despite the rest of the film was kept grounded.Other than this, and the fact that a side character was able to pull a MVP hit out of thin air, the movie is very enjoyable. There is some truly breathtaking scenes and there's plenty of memorable martial arts scenes to go around. Growing up with these kung fu movies, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",10 September 2021
mangoturtle, Better than Expected.,"Wow, this movie was honestly a lot better than I thought it'd be. The action was well done, had good humor, and had a good story with great CGI in it. I was engaged throughout it. The acting was good and believable, especially by the antagonist. I'm impressed and proved wrong, I didn't expect a movie of this level. Not impressed by the soundtrack, but that doesn't take away much from the experience.",6 September 2021

El-Ak, What a poor movie!,"Didn't feel until the credits that it's a Marvel movie. By comparing it to other Marvel movies, it ranks among the lowest in terms of VFX, story and acting.

witra_as, Seamlessly combined modern martial arts fantasy and Asian mythology into MCU fashion,"Seamlessly combined modern martial arts fantasy and Asian mythology without cringe/dull moments made it a different kind of MCU movies to entertain international audience.Mind few (back and forth) narrative problems, Destin Daniel Cretton successfully put humor and heart in right time and places.Thanks to scintillating cast who lit up the screen especially charismatic Tony Leung.Chemistry between Simu & Awkwafina as besties are undeniably good.Action scenes including CGI works definitely made some nice highlights.Going to watch it over and over again, IMAX gave better experience for sure 😁",24 September 2021
Avery-WanSacritic, Tradition Meets Modern,"I was blown away by the great storyline from start to finish, amazing choreography, stunning visuals, and surreal locales. It's happy, it's sad, it's funny, it's touching. It knows when to be serious and knows when to be hilarious. The blend between the classic Asian traditions and the modern world was a definite bonus. Plus, it focuses on a blend between mythical and natural. Besides that, it ties into the MCU seamlessly. The movie thankfully explains a connection between the faux Ten Rings in the Iron Man movies and the actual Ten Rings. I also enjoyed all of the Easter eggs. This movie was worth the wait.",4 September 2021

sujanfaster, The New Normal (MARVEL),"After a brief gap of theatrical release (not considering Black Widow as it had a partial release), MARVEL is back in theatres introducing to the characters of the new phase of their universe. Shang Chi The Legend Of Ten Rings is a standalone film but equally also serves as an important piece of puzzle in the events linking to the web series' and upcoming movies. It goes without saying that watching all the recently released series on Disney+ is as important as following these movies in order.As the trailer shows and also the name suggests Shang Chi is a movie whose action heavily lean towards the martial arts and individual battles. It is a different watch as compared to other MARVEL movies which involve a lot of hi tech dependent action. The movie hardly wastes any time on the lead character's introduction and straightway jumps into the 'purpose'. Having experienced the 'blip' after the infinity war, the normal people aren't surprised anymore when supernatural things and high octane action happens around them. Hence the character here is hardly wasting any time on hiding their identities from the public. The storyline is pretty straightforward and the movie has strong resemblance to Black Panther because of the lead character's connection to his place of origin. The action sequences are shot brilliantly and some of the camera and lighting work is mind blowing. The movie relies on good hand to hand combat almost until the climax and I believe if MARVEL had gone for an R rating, the action sequences would have been much better to watch. I personally think some incidents happening around climax were way too convenient. Last but not the least, the background music just elevates most scenes into a whole new level.Simu Liu has what it takes to bring the Asian heritage to the superhero universe. The movie doesn't test much of his emotional side and I believe we will get to see more in the upcoming movies. Tony Leung shines in his powerful antagonist role and Awkwafina drives the comical side of things as Shang Chi's close buddy who is almost a sidekick. Rest of the cast have done a decent job and do look out for a surprise funny cameo ;-)MARVEL expands its universe with Shang Chi by exploring a different culture and heritage in the superhero genre. It is a satisfying watch for a MARVEL fan and a great watch for any action movie fans.",4 September 2021
Bubba32618, This is one of the great MCU movies!,"Shang-Chi is fantastic, it's like a Bruce Lee movie meets a Marvel movie. One of the better Marvel movies. I love that they brought back Ben Kingsley to play Trevor, which he was one of my favorite characters in this movie and it is fixing his character as the Mandarin in Iron Man 3. I love that Ben Kingsley knows that most people didn't like him as the Mandarin. The insistence Planet of the Apes is played by real Monkeys is hilarious. I love the Mandarin in this movie he was my favorite character in this movie besides, Morris, Morris is the best character ever. Morris is great. The Mandarin in this movie is one of my favorite Marvel villains ever. The Ten Rings are very interesting. The bus scene at the beginning is awesome. The opening scene was also quite good. The fighting and the choreography is very well done. The dragons are very cool looking and them fighting was cool. It was nice to see Wong in this and it was nice to see him fight the Abomination. The action scenes are really cool and Simu Liu is great as Shang-Chi. I really like his character a lot and his acting is quite good. I really like the plot, it is simple but I really enjoyed it. Meng' er Zhang is good as Xialing as well. My biggest flaw is Awkwafina, she isn't as bad in this as she was in Raya and the Last Dragon and she is funny in this some of the time but I just don't think I like her very much. It will be cool to see Shang-Chi return in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. I really enjoyed this and it was one of the better Marvel movies.",12 September 2021
teomslaer, Great visuals but slow moving,"Well the fight scenes were exciting , the story was incredibly slow. Not the best Marvel movie but not as weak as movies like Thor: The Dark World. Some of the best visuals in any movie I have seen which helps improve the overall experience. Keep an eye out for a fun character to pop up as well!",3 September 2021
bozopauk, Just another Marvel movie,"In no way, this marvel movie differs from what they are creating lately. Great CGI, little of any story, some randomly placed jokes that are mostly not at all funny, bunch of random action and fantasy with no limitations to its imagination.Jokes by Awkwafina are terrible, I find her extremely unpleasent to watch, like kevin hart i find it so forced and unnatural, jokes are terrible and not at all suited for the moment. Unnecesearily taking the focus of the plot.Story plot is so basic, when you look back at what happened in the movie, yeah, nothing much happens really, it is like 3 proper events and rest is just to prolong the movie for no reason.Things that happen action wise in the movie, arent quite connected and I often got a feeling something happens out of nowhere, it can be predicted always, but still it is not logical for it to happen actually, it is just that to plot is so obvious that you know such illogical action will happen.And personal touch to it, I prefer when fantasy has its limitations as well, when you know what characters are capable of in that fantasy world, I really dont like when all of sudden some character pulls of superpower move or some other capability that was never earlier mentioned or done, and that move just changes everything makes him beat everyone.",11 November 2021

This is more like a Bruce Lee or Crouching Tiger type filmThe film's setting is unique as is the style and story. The story is quite weak at points but it keeps you entertained. The acting was great although Awkwafina's character (Kathy) does get quite irritating at times.

kthngm," It's ok, but not great",So Shang chi has an evil Kung fu father with sci Fi bracelets and an air bender mother. He leaves his father behind to pursue a simpler chilled life in Sam Francisco and then they the fathers organization attacks him and brings him back to have him help and get to his mothers home village. In the village he fights his father and wins and then fights anime looking monsters which are like dementors/ soul suckers. He gets help from a water bending dragon and defeats the king monster by performing an exorcism with his bracelets. Acting wasn't amazing but let's all appreciate how cool Morris was. Probably the best character in the movie.,2 September 2021

The action sequences are awesomely bad-A, the jokes and comedic scenes are hilarious and never unfunny, the cgi is great, the emotional scenes hit hard, and the cinematography is gorgeous. And it's also something fresh and unique, and it doesn't feel like a Marvel movie (if that makes sense) which I like, and it also brings something new to the MCU. Overall, this film is fantastic, and sometimes even emotional, and I recommend you go watch this at the cinema for the full experience. 10/10.",4 October 2021
chitreshgupta," A beautiful film in every way, shape, and form","'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is absolutely on my list of favorite Marvel movies. 2021 has been full of hyped up films that have ultimately left me disappointed, but this one lives up to every bit of its hype.The action from beginning to end was some of the best I've seen in a Marvel movie or in general in a very long time. The choreography, especially when performed by Michelle Yeoh, Meng'er Zhang, and Fala Chen (and stunt doubles) felt like poetry in motion. Everything was done with so much grace and elegance that I did not want it to end. Simu Liu brought both charisma and charm as Shang-Chi while delivering some amazing action sequences too. He was nothing short of fitting for the role. And to my surprise ""Awkwafina"" was not as unbearable as I assumed she would be.The movie does lose some momentum in the 3rd act as it slows down a bit and takes a deeper dive into the story, but quickly picks back up as you head into the final battle. The set and CGI used creates some breathtaking shots that adds to the greatness of the film.Marvel fan or not this film is worth going to see.",9 September 2021

mohalhamouri," Good production, bad selection of actors/actresses","To begin with, no one on this movie is known or famous. Literally no one. They spend a huge amount on production and then a small budget is kept for the actors and actresses. It would have been a blockbuster if they have added some famous names to the movie.To make matters most, why would you hire Aquafina in an action movie. It is just mind blowing, she just doesn't fit in the movie. She always have a dumb look on her face which translates into ""what in the world am i doing here?!"". What is worse than that is her ridiculous lime green pants which she doesn't change for the entire length of the movie. Disappointing movie.",18 November 2021
sirinow, Underrated as hell!!,One of the best marvel movies. Great story line. Mature cast and scenes with amazing screenplay on fights. The BGM was top notch. Very trendy with some nice techno/pop beats. I loved the cast a lot. Everyone had great chemistry together. The storyline was strong and well executed. There was a bit of everything.

extol_d, Jackie Chan meets Donnie Yen meets Captain America,"I really, really enjoyed the movie. The fight scenes in particular. As a fan of old school Kung Fu movies and the way they design the fighting scenes to look was just my cup of tea. That built up and exceled when the super hero fighting took place as well, it was just fighting perfection for me.The soundtrack of this movie was off the charts, starting from the opening scene, to the train fight scene and throughout.Now the visuals... they were... stunning.Humour was well placed and got a giggle or two out of the whole cinema, especially with Trevor, hahah.If it had just a biiiiiit of more depth in the story it would be a 10/10.",8 September 2021
ktazefidan, A pilot movie,"To avoid long review, here are some bullet points.-chinese audience and all of us deserve better.Positive:
actors are OK. Younger ones were even better.-Fighting / choreography is good
some scenes are well made.Negative:
-half of the movie is in mandarin. You can't focus. Either don't put subtitles at all or use english.-animation and effects are 2nd rate
-pace is weird
-humor isn't bad but I didn't feel it. Starts to early.-too many explanations and flashbacks -> bad writing
-music at some weird parts
-I watched it on d+ and not at the highest resolution but the quality was on a tv show level. Usually at higher res it looks worse.There is no disney magic like in mulan or the quality that you expect. It was like pilot movie.",13 November 2021
mdhumayonkabir, The story is good but there is problems with other aspects of this movie.,"The best aspects of this movie is hand to hand combats(without the rings) and Simu Liu is awesome in it and embraces the character. The story is good if consider standalone which it is but I have problems with other aspects of movie elements. The entire movie is shooted in closed studio environment with huge set pieces (Marvel is doing such things for last many movies e.g, the last 2 Avengers movies). It is very very very stupid to look at and the non sensical vfx. Still remember the first Iron man movie in which the original and vfx elements are hard to distinguish and have had a good balance in reality and fantasy world. The movie is forcing the humours too in some cases. In some case they tried to mimic Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. This movie certainly have some asian vibe in movie making style but I think there were manipulation in making by studio over creator. The music of the movie is good. Overall it's a good movie. I am going to give any special attention for other upcoming marvel movies( Maybe because I left behind my fantasy world). I think there will not be any 'Classic' from marvel in upcoming future.",12 September 2021

nam3s," Beautiful, imaginative, and refreshing.","The action, martial arts, and cinematography is top-notch. I find myself nodding in awe and saying ""wow"" in many scenes. I'm left craving for more action. I love the idea of power being combined with skill. The martial arts element really adds creativity and a whole new world of moves and skills open up. It's not a bunch of powerful people throwing out nonstop blasts or a strong thing throwing brute punching left and right.The world is beautiful. The musical guides you. The tone filled with art and symbolism. Beautiful all around. And shoutout to Ronny Chieng! Seeing him make an appearance was pretty funny.With some of the weaker elements I will have to point to the pacing. There were a few moments that felt dragged out or unnecessary. Some screen time was given to certain characters that didn't need it and they should focus a little more time on certain relationships.Overall I enjoyed the movie and lot and was left craving for more.",10 September 2021

rafiado, One Of Marvel Masterpiece,"I watched this movie last night and it was really really epic I feel like I was in Shang chi world (Ta-Lo) was so beautiful, so many beautiful and unique creatures. I didn't expect that Shang chi would be so good and so epic like this, but sometimes the CGI it looks like not done, but it was okey cause they give us the best visual. I Was Really Proud that Niki and Rich Brian was in Shang Chi SoundtrackWhen Mandarin acting died I was really sad but when that little creature come to him, and mandarin was said ""it was acting, come on pretend to be die"" and that was so funnyThe Ending was look like Godzilla vs Kong maybe cause the monster and the monster was fighting and Shang chi weapon was so strong. And it's kinda sad cause his dad die in front of Shang chi.This movie it doesn't feels like 2 hours but it's feels like 1 hours and I really really really wanna watch this movie again so bad. I can't Wait for the sequel. Edit : And now i watched this movie again 3 times.I really recommend you to watch this movie on cinemas now!, cause you will feel like you go to Ta-Lo Shang-Chi beautiful fantasy place.

On the outside it well made and well acted and an enjoyable film. However it has some issues and for me, didn't live up to the hype. Basically it's a Jackie Chan movie where Jackie Chan is played my Simu Liu and Chris Rock is played by Awkwafina. And suddenly (or not) mysticism. It almost doesn't feel like a traditional Marvel Movie. If it weren't for the ""surprise"" cameos here and there, and the almost laisez fare comment referring to Avengers: Endgame, you'd be hard pressed to believe it is one.

It just fell flat in my opinion, there is nothing in this movie that screams it should be a 7 or higher.It could be because I'm not too crazy about martial art films but I still wanted to give it a try instead of completely ignoring it. I want to at least gives some points for them trying something new and not forcing diversity by changing characters race/etc.Overall probably a watch once and be done with it just so once he shows up in another avengers movie you'll know his backstory I guess.",19 December 2021

joncolley, Fun story with a deadly dull middle act,"I was actually borderline giving this a 7 out of 10 but can't quite bring myself to do it because the middle is so booooooring!I did however, on the whole really enjoy this but I did think that it was more about the whole cast rather than an origin story of Shang-Chi because an awful lot of attention seems to be given his sister and his friend Katy which seemed odd to me?But sort of odd in a good way because they managed to flesh the characters out enough to make them seem like 'characters' rather than expendable supporting cast.The first third of the movie was for me, the strongest and seeing the full fight scene on the bus shown in the trailer made me appreciate the choreography that went into this. The final third was fine... I wasn't bored... The middle though? Nah :(I preferred this to Black Widow because it's part of the new phase and not some remnant carry over and just felt fresh!There's also some fairly ok humour in there (a lot which misses the mark too though)... yeah, it was good, you should go see it if you like the MCU.",4 September 2021
felixdenomme, A great Kung-Fu movie.,"Shang-Chi, is an excellent Kung-Fu movie. And it's the less ""Marvel"" movie of the Marvel movies. I mean that as a compliment. There's not much connection to anything else. Not 50 characters included for no reasons. Not a ""check it out guys, it's gonna be so cool in the next movie, I promise!"" vibe, that damages the story.It's basically a less poetic and less romantic ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Michelle Yeoh (still friggin awesome and butt-kicking at 59 years-old) is even playing in both movies.There's pretty colors, fantastical elements, comedy elements... but under everything, there's a cool story of revenge, of abandonment, of murder, of family and grief. Well, it's a great Kung-Fu movie, not a formulaic super-hero movie.Simu Liu is really charismatic and the fight scenes are awesome (some still sucks, though, because of too much CGI).The actress that plays Shang-Chi's sister is great too and I hope we see her in more movies.Well, everybody is fantastic in the movie (especially Ben Kingsley).It's been a while that I didn't loved a Marvel movie so much and it gives me some optimism on what can still happen with the MCU.",2 September 2021
alindsayal, A Great Origin Film,"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.Main Character
Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.Supporting Characters
Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.Story
The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.Script
The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.Style
The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.Overall
Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.Rating - 8/10.",18 December 2021
tkgbjenn1, Disney or Marvel?,"This feels like a Disney movie rather than a Marvel movie. And a mediocre one at that. Hopefully this isn't the future of Marvel. The only positive are the fighting scenes. The choreography is truly impressive. But the constant ""awe"" of the fantasy world makes for some bad acting.",13 November 2021
sonyabrockman, Lots of fun,"Great combination of high energy action, emotional context, and funny. It was a great introduction to these characters. Looking forward to seeing them more!",4 September 2021
Aleacity, Pedestrian,"After a promising and colorful opening in a magical forest, the movies meanders. It is like a lesser Disney movie, but with a few good fight scenes. The fight on the bus is maybe the best. The lead actor is good, but he is given little to do; same for Akwafina. So many scenes in the first half are shot in low lighting, for no good reason. Everything else is meh or plain silly.",26 October 2021
crp-49946, Disappointed,"Bad acting, boring story and incredibly cheesy. I didn't bother watching it all. The random woman that's in it throughout is purely irritating. Honestly don't waste your time and don't trust its 7 star rating. I'd rather watch banana man. Complete rubish.",10 November 2021
wind90, This is DEFINETLY not a waste (for a marvel film),"---Fast review: Good effect, exciting figth scenes, satisfying story---> I normally don't like most marvel movies because bla bla..
> However, as a martial arts fan, performer and chinese culture and mythology fan, i decided to watch it (because there is use of martial arts) and unexpectedly satisfied.> There is a good base, universe of chinese mythology. They may waste it but they definetly use it very well. Effects are realy good, i especially like effects of portals and water tornado of dragon.> Fight scenes (which is the most interested part for me of course) are really good, some parts are so fast to detect movements.> Visual effects of kung fu (not style of main character but his mother and her people) describe the philosophy under the style very well. Their kung fu is so smooth, basic and easily recognisable because most is traditional style.>I was very happy when i saw some movements that i use.",9 September 2021
Harry_Gleeson, Another solid entry,"After the big disappointment of Black Widow, it's safe to say I was anticipating a better outing for Shang Chi and thankfully I lived up.The action is the films biggest plus point. It's where the best scenes are on show, the choreography is brilliant alongside its kung fu/John Wick style fights.The visuals are typical of a Marvel film, solid as always. The film however lost its emotional resonance through its writing. The heart of a film mainly comes from the screenplay and I felt the writing was slightly lazy in parts and that heart faded.It's neither a perfect nor terrible film, it's a solid one that I enjoyed, even if it was hard to truly gravitate towards the characters.Quote - 'Welcome to the Circus' - WongRating - 3/5.",9 September 2021

felipeamaral-87249, A really generic and a Marvel pattern movie,Marvel Studios apparently doesnt learn from its mistakes while they are profitable and makes another movie with tons of jokes instead of focussing on character development.,5 September 2021
dmv_gary, Actually quite a well-done movie,"Wasn't expecting much due to the recent Black Widow experience, but was fairly surprised by the quality of this film. The storyline is still the cliche origin story, but this one has good action sequences, good character building, good exploration into the core ideas of our culture, good representation of some of the mythical beens in it, actors speaking actual Mandarin Chinese not some weird ones with alien accents that Hollywood used to think is Chinese. Phase 4 of MCU looks a bit more promising after this. A solid 6 for pass.1 more star for Leung Chiu-Wai, this is one of those where the ""villain"" is more likeable than the protagonist. Without his performance this whole thing would have been so mundane.",12 September 2021

josh_has_mail, Must see marvel film! 9.25/10,"This movie was absolutely phenomenal! The acting, the fight choreography, the visuals, the villain, the lore, the story it was all superb! I went into this movie only seeing the first teaser so I didn't really know what to expect. What I got was a beautifully crafted epic journey that made me surprisingly emotional at some parts which was very welcomed for a marvel film. My main worry was awkwafina because I really can't stand her as an actress but man she was GREAT in this. Everyone was pretty great honestly. Also watch this stoned if you can...there are some crazy awesome visuals in this film! Easily the best solo MCU film since Iron Man 1.",3 September 2021

jaidanh, One of the top 10 best Marvel movies,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is very different from all previous Marvel movies, which is a good thing. I was a little worried at first that the film might not live up to the success Marvel pushed to give, but the film was actually spectacular and very entertaining. Good story, good acting, excellent character development, the action and choreography are outstanding, some funny moments, beautiful cinematography, and the VFX are a major step-up from previous Marvel films. This film was almost like the Aquaman of the MCU because it was a fun experience seeing it on the screen and presenting fans with something entirely new and unfamiliar. This movie is practically flawless. Can't wait to see Shang-Chi in future Marvel movies.",8 September 2021

njevelina, Predictable Chinese storyline. All hail Awkwafina & Wong!,"I really wanna do the Michael Pena summary, but here's a MUCH shorter version:So its like a Joy of Luck Club mini reunion, but then there's this parkour on crack session... but then they ride Mr Weasley's enchanted car to this Chinese Wakanda, and then ride Mulan's Mushu to fight the Chinese Kraken and save the world... and basically Awkwafina and Wong steal the show! Welcome to the hotel Californiaaasa!",7 September 2021
starjump, Mystical magic.,"This is one of my favourite Marvel origin films.The storyline, visuals, the cast, fight and stunt scenes were amazing. In fact I'd say it was beautiful and respectfully made.Simu is perfect as Shang-Chi, sorry I doubted his casting as kept thinking of Jung from Kim's Convenience (good show).",10 September 2021
reginocaelorum, A bright start to the new phase of Marvel Studios!,"Marvel has started its new era, which will be interesting for their old fans and will attract the attention of new audience. The film's director, Deston Creton, did a good job. Perfectly selected cast of actors who have done their tasks for 100%. They understand their characters and clearly convey their emotions. Gorgeous costumes and Joel West's soundtracks, with Chinese motives, aptly create an atmosphere of a magical world we haven't seen before. I won't say anything bad about the script either. I didn't mantion any plot holes, and the bonus was good jokes and a touching and sometimes tragic family story. Bill Pope's balanced shots and amazing special effects, which have definitely reached a new level, also go to the film's pluses. A special tribute to the director of the fights Andy Chang. Clear movements and dynamic music make such scenes a real spectacle. This film is worth your attention.My rating is 8.5 / 10.",4 September 2021

samuelelegolasfilippi," Not bad how Iron Man 3 and Thor 2, but not very good.","Shang chi is not the classic Marvel movie and I appreciate that. The direction in two situations is brilliant otherwise nothing special. The plot does not tell me much and the motivation of the villain (the Mandarin) I find very stupid. We see that Marvel is focusing a lot on Shang chi, especially for the scene after the credits. The characters are not very characterized, except in the relief comic. Overall I find it a forgettable film, apart from two action scenes.",8 October 2021
srivineet," The calm of the west, expressed in a subtle way.",Action packed movie with comedy... and the KAMEHAMEHA.....,5 September 2021
amanhalid, Predictable yet eye candy,"An enjoyable movie and has some witty humor and other familiar aspects from marvel, the execution was done right but was still pretty predictable. There was no blood with slashes and hits which made it really feel like a kid's movie. The premise and plot are great but what that leads the characters to do... is very predictable. When I saw Shang chi exit the elevator into an under ground facility, I already knew he would fight and that it would be his sister. The family dynamic didn't fit right at all, especially the way the family interacted with eachother after what I've seen in the flashbacks. The choreography was spectacular even though some fights made it seem like the 2 characters fight were still going easy on eachother.I predicted like 80% of what was gonna happen like :
The sister fighting the brother in the fighting ring
Dad dying and giving Shang chi the rings
Girl learning the bow
The two teams working together in the final fight
EtcOverall, a good watch!",17 January 2022
ProbablyHuman, A disappointment: predictable and shallow,"The movie's CGI and action sequences were top tier, but the story and writing, the most important parts of a film, were predictable and simplistic.Character motives were shallow and stereotypical and I was not emotionally invested in the family or any individual character. Once you understand that the movie is about family, which you can pick up right away, the plot, conflicts, and resolution are entirely predictable.The movie had its classic Marvel funny moments (diffusing tense moments with surprising humor), but I cringed in plenty of scenes too. This movie had a poor ending with little emotional catharsis. The ultimate conflict was resolved with CGI, magic, and deus ex machinas, like the average action blockbuster, which might have been acceptable if it had emotional depth or moral complexity, but it didn't.Overall, the movie was a typical superhero film about family bonds with Kung Fu and dragons. As much as I love the Chinese representation, as I am Chinese, the movie itself was disappointing.",5 September 2021
levius-46895, Anyone rating this movie less then a 8 needs to be drug tested,"This Movie was AMAZING ,beautiful to look at and had awesome action scenes as well as gripping story that at times even pulled on your heart strings.

stanfilmguy," Good martial art fight scenes, but that's it","The martial art scenes that aren't full of cgi are beautiful and a nice tribute to old cinema. But after that it breaks down. It's a predictable cgi fest, with mediocre characters.I thought Awakafina was great, everyone else was average. Though it was meant to be a martial arts superhero film, it ended up just a marvel film.I enjoyed it. But it was forgettable, and sorry to mention it again but the cgi got on my nerves. The dragons and stuff where ok cgi but got repetitive.Overall worth watching, but noting special. Except the martial arts where beautiful.",11 September 2021
sbaker-03732, Another Marvel Great,"Perfect casting, great flow throughout, solid story and character development. Great movie to take the family to watch.

Rlyt96, Better than I expected,"When I saw the trailer a while back I wasn't expecting much, especially after Black Widow which was imo the worst MCU movie. However, the movie surprised me. The theme of a different culture reminded me of Black Panther but I enjoyed Shang Chi a lot more. I found it refreshing, the visuals were amazing, I enjoyed the action scenes very much. The plot wasn't the worst, but I felt like it was dragging out at times.Overall a very fun and enjoyable movie.",10 September 2021
btguilherme, My favorite Marvel movie so far!,"For a guy like me, that grown up watching Jackie Chan's kung fu movies, this film was a wonderful experience!Besides all the perfect fight scenes and amazing special effects the story telling was terrific, I was completely moved by Shang-Chi's story and his family's.And the ending was awesome as well! I don't have too much to say, just a wonderful feeling that this movie gave me!",6 September 2021
ladyliliroche, More like Shang-Chi and the legend of Tao Lo,"Or maybe WenWu and the legend of Tao Lo...Felt like it could be better. Shang-Chi barely feel like a main character. He felt like a side kick who got thrown around from point A to B to finish off WenWu's arc.Shang-Chi didn't have much struggle. His inner demons of unable to help his mother felt meh because he was just a kid when it happened. It was more of his father's fault for not having any security or maids in the house. Its a large house and he is a well off man, I am sure he could afford some security.Having some security doesn't mean the mom couldn't be killed too. Maybe the mom died trying to protect one of the maid or the children. It'll added more stakes and trauma to the poor kids.The ten rings were never fully explored too. Thought each of them will have unique power, but they just some electric power telekinesis kinda thing. Brute force basically. Shang-Chi never expressing wanting to be worthy of the ten rings also makes them hollow. They are just as sentimental as a normal sword. A weapon basically. Which is fine but when the movie called Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings, I expected more Ten Rings instead of mythical bats and dragon.Tony Leung is amazing though. The opening scene was basically the best. The battle dance between them was so well done it deserves everything.... But Kung Fu Panda is still the best martial arts movie.",12 November 2021
masonsaul, Incredible MCU origin story,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways. It's definitely the best thing in phase 4 so far even if it's third act has some of the usual MCU problems.Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. The fight choreography is extremely impressive and the CG is mostly strong. It's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by Joel P. West are both fantastic.",4 September 2021

Avwillfan89, Fantastic new entry to the MCU,"I'm not someone who is a fan of action movies. I'm really not. But even here, there's no denying the action sequences are brilliantly executed and have a lot more of a hit than most of the marvel movies out there.Although Simu Liu falters a little bit as a leading man, he has a truly impressive cast to support him. Awkwafina is brilliantly funny and quippy as she always is. And Tony Leung, the complex antagonist and the hero's father, has the most depth in this film.The visual effects are beyond beautiful. They reminded me of Ferngully, and the nature I observed as a child. Good stuff!There are some surprising cameos that are both hilarious and wholesome.It was so good to see it in Imax after such a long cinema hiatus. Definitely check this one out!",5 September 2021
AnotherPersonInTheWorld, Designed to be watched on your phone,"Well this is where we are going with marvel movies now, very simple plots and poor cgi.I dont know if this was rushed of they just don't care, but the cgi looks about the quality of a computer game, maybe you wouldn't notice if you were watching on a tv or your phone but it fails on the big screen.Story is predictable, nothing novel or original. I guess the production line that is Disney will just be churning these movies out now.",14 November 2021

jamiedarlow-37510, Destin Daniel Cretton; you've done it again!,"Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973. Beginning in the first of many gorgeously choreographed and shot sequences, we're introduced to Shang-Chi's father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and mother Li (Fala Chen) also entailing the awesome power of the Ten Rings which Xu currently has in his possession. What follows is a heart-pounding and ridiculously entertaining adventure movie with true heart.Filled with beautiful performances not least from everyone already mentioned and including Awkwafina as Shaun's best friends Katy and Meng'er Zhang as sister Xialing, there's plenty here to adore on screen not even getting to the truly awe-inspiring action set pieces with the best fight scenes I've seen in recent memory. Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) is very quickly becoming one of my favourite directors having produced three incredible pieces of cinema in the last 8 years. It's great to see that his passion for storytelling and independent spirit still shines through his latest here while also staying true to the Marvel fan base (I really did not expect a certain character to show up but made for some really comical moments).The visual effects are of course stunning but what makes them stand out here are how they're incorporated with the beautiful landscapes to enhance the feeling of authentically experiencing Shaun's heritage and getting wrapped up in the culture that the filmmakers so wonderfully explore. This is how origin stories should be made! The creature design is also incredible and is an integral element to making the final sequences all the more breathtaking.Please do yourselves a favour and see this on the biggest screens possible, please support your local cinema and stay safe my friends.",3 October 2021
napchier, Felt a bit too Disney to me,"I know Disney and Marvel are linked, but it really did feel more like a Disney movie to me, a live action alternative to a Pixar animation. It's good, a nice origin story, but seemed quite soft. The main bad guy was good, his guys not so good. The main characters were all very good, some story elements not so good. I'll probably see it again, and might well enjoy it more next time.",17 October 2021

chazt-04045, YAWN,This was by far the most boring MCU title I've seen to date. It was basically two hours of the same fight scene done over and over. I really hope this isn't indicative of the direction the MCU is headed post-Endgame.,13 September 2021
breadandhammers, Exciting and heartwarming,"After being burned by Mulan last year, I went into this film with very low expectations, but was delighted to find this movie was wonderful to watch. Tony Leung, as the misguided villain trying to resurrect his wife and Shaun's mother, is the breakout star here, and his storyline - along with Leung's acting - is so magnificent that it sort of overshadows the other characters, including Shaun. This film is exciting, yet also heartwarming.",6 September 2021
safeatbase," Beautiful, exciting, emotional, and daring!","I knew nothing about the comic book character and was curious how a martial arts character fits into the Avengers universe. The trailer didn't make me all that excited, but after seeing the movie I know why. SO MUCH is not shown in the previews, and it is all amazing content. There were a lot of surprises from characters to choreography, style to substance, and action to emotion. The film makes the complexity of family love its core, and that's what makes Shang-Chi such a riveting story. The villain is not a bad guy. His motive is love, not power. Despite what advantage the Ten Rings gives him, his current life is a transformed one for the better, until the indomitable enemy that is grief comes into his life.While, yes, this is an origin story, it doesn't feel like it in the typical MCU formula, which is very relieving. Shang-Chi doesn't go through training. He's already trained. His enemy isn't a pop-up for fighting's sake. It's his father who conjures conflict to fight against or try to love. Adding in the sibling complexity gives the movie more layers and more emotional stakes that are pretty raw throughout and huge in the third act. They wish their father would love them their way, not his, and try desperately to sober his longing to be rid of his grief. It makes all the balls-to-wall fantasy that's exponentially unleashed.And with this movie, Marvel tested its bravery wisely by leveraging the gorgeous art and culture of China. The fights choreographed more like dancing is so captivating. The rich, calm soundtrack that plays sensually throughout ramps you into the grand fantasy in the third act.Shang-Chi has no flaws that I can find. Acting, characters, story, soundtrack, script, and settings. None of it is weak. Shang-Chi is the best solo Marvel character film since Winter Soldier, and may surpass it.",3 October 2021
kluseba, Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.",17 September 2021
johan-magnuseriksson-185-97383, A long 90-ies scene without a story,"I have no Idea of why they were really fighting, it felt arbitrary like they just made up something randomly that didn't really make sense. It felt more like a 80ies story then an modern MCU story.This is not a superhero movie, and maybe that's why they lost me, because I was expecting a superhero film.

Camerenth, Marvel made a great martial arts movie.,"This movie's biggest strength is the action. It is so well choreographed and so well captured in camera that it is unlike any movie I've seen. That aside, the characters are solid and give depth to the family dynamic at the heart of the story. Where it fumbles is in the third act that feels like it contrasts a lot that it tried to set up in order to have an over the top fantastical element to the show. Overall very enjoyable and is probably the most appealing Marvel movie since Black Panther.",7 September 2021
threenorns-1," Lush, beautiful film that could have used a bit less dignity","Watched Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings - despite the movie title sounding like one of those 1940s black and white ""Detective Dee and the...."" types, the film is visually stunning: stunning scenery, magical creatures, gorgeous costumes, no-holds-barred fight scenes that are as much dancing as fighting, you name it.I do have issues, however. The first is that I think Marvel was so worried about offending China or the Chinese people that the film comes across as very safe. Far too much on its dignity. If the film were a job interview, it would have been for the position of senior Vice President at the Chinese equivalent of the Louvre. Even Akwafina, who I usually count on to deliver a raunchy belly-laugh of a good time, was very composed and restrained.I'm also wondering why they bothered including Shang-Chi's sister. She doesn't really *do* anything except be moody and resentful for the majority of the film. Even in the after-scene, she's not there. As far as I can tell, the entire point of her inclusion in the film is to get Shang-Chi to Macau (bonus points for it not being the overused Hong Kong or Singapore!).Dignity or not, there was plenty of opportunity where they could have upped the humour quotient. The Chinese people are dignified - famous for it - but they also have a ribald and sophisticated sense of humour. I would have *loved* to see sly digs at Western culture, more commentary on differences between East and West (you can't tell me a guy spends his life in an isolated Chinese compound or in the States then just seamlessly segues to Macau's urban lifestyle!), that kind of thing - more than the stereotypical ""When are you getting married? When are you going to get a real job?"" conversation. Basically, they could have really *done* something with this movie, over and above a superhero story.One thing I *really* want to see is a guide to the creatures we see in the film. They are so beautifully rendered! The Fu Dogs, for example - I was mesmerized watching the tiny little movements - ear flicks, muscle twitches as if reacting to a bug bite, the movement of the fur and mane: magnificent! But there were so many others I have no clue what they were other than they looked like Chinese mythological creatures and I would love to know more about them.",4 September 2021
callumjones-40834, Something new. Something amazing!,I was not expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I'm a sucker for a good martial arts movie and for traditional oriental music but we saw what happened the last time Marvel tried to do martial arts... (Iron Fist)This movie is without question in my top 5 Marvel movies! The action is incredibly choreographed and there is not an overabundance of it. The score is beautiful and I have found myself listening to it regularly since I saw this film. Character development is top notch. All of these things needed to make a great movie is wrapped into a nice package sprinkled with that Marvel charm we have come to love over the years. I can't stress how much you need to see this movie.,6 September 2021
mesaxi, Didn't feel like Marvel,"Shang-Chi has always been a weaker Marvel character, but they've managed to make good movie with lame characters before. So why didn't this one work? It ultimately felt like a Chinese movie that was polished up by Marvel in post. There was far too much time spent promoting Chinese culture, and after 2 hours I was still confused as to what exactly the Rings do. The superheroes powers were little more than a McGuffin in this movie. I may not be the audience they were shooting for, but it still felt weak.They also stole a fight scene from Rush Hour 2.",16 November 2021
fuyinyu, Bad,"Can't tell the tightness and profoundness of Chinese culture at all
The title is Shang-Chi, but I don't see where the ""Chi"" is.

Pairic, A great adventure,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: The origin story of Shang Chi, his father Xu Wenwu found the Ten Rings of power 1,000 years ago and trough history has been a conqueror and Robber Baron. In 1996 he found Ta Lo a mystical village, but is beaten by it's guardian. Ying Li. They fall in love and have two children, Shang Li and his sister Xiang. Tragedy strikes and Shang Chi is raised to be an assassin, his sister trains in secret. The story is about Xu wanting his children to join with him in a strange quest but things don't go smoothly. Modern style gin battles and those involving mystical weapons abound, well choreographed as are the martial arts sequnces. One great fight aboard a runaway San Francisco bus on those hills. We also have a Cthuluesque devourer of souls with it's flying minions who battle a Chinese Flying Dragon (he's the good guy). There's also a faceless ""winged wombat"" and other mythological beasts. A great adventure. Directed and Co-Written by Destin Daniel Cretton. 8/10.",9 September 2021
IQ42, Asia coming to MCU,"I adore everything Asian and was pumped to experience this movie!And indeed, the Asian elements in it were awesome - though (probably) somewhat westernized. I loved the obvious folklore creature, the dragon. I loved the chinese scenes. I loved the little cultural aspects.The martial arts scenes were freaking beautiful! It's been long (if ever?) since I've seen such cool hand-to-hand combat. Usually these mundane combat scenes bore me to death but when Shang-Chi started fighting in the bus, I was so surprised at how cool it was!But other than that, I'm not sure if they really used the Eastern setting to the full extent possible. The story was pretty meh. A desperate dad due to his dead wife teaches his children to be assassins and then later somehow attack them for little reason because he is clouded by a dark presence? Meh.Also, what's even the deal with the ten rings? The movie is about the legend of the ten rings but the most explanation we've got from it was in the credit scene. Doesn't feel fitting.Many other elements also felt cliche, illogical or too contrived for plot purposes. Simply put, I feel like the overall story was very sloppy.Dan shi hai ke yi ba!",17 December 2021

sacrypheyes, An average movie at best,"I have no idea of what the story of this character is in the comics, but the way it was depicted in this movie was okay-ish at most, and is barely entertaining, thanks to the usual AAA SFX.Not sure if this is supposed to please asian people with their full asian cast (i don't count cameos), the same way black panther was to black people but i pretty much find it ridiculous everytime a movie does this sort of thing.",18 November 2021

benjaminskylerhill, Looking forward to the Sonic crossover,"They certainly picked the right director for this film; he seemed to understand that this script has a plot with too many generic elements and characters that are just serviceable.

Simi Liu has nailed the new superhero character. The choreography was brilliant, the VFX was pretty well done, and the cast and crew did such an amazing job making this movie happen.

michelleeichu, Good enough but too late,"It's beautifully shot and cinematography and locations excellent. I was a bit confused by the ending but that's alright I guess. They did quite good on the worldbuilding but as someone who has watched a ton of Chinese dramas with richer worldbuilding and characters it didn't amaze me.A Decent MCU movie in its own right they just should've made this earlier, like before Iron man 3 (?) Or something.",6 February 2022
aidanratesmovies," A fun time at the movies, and that's all it really needed to be","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.My Rating: 8.6/10.",4 September 2021
GomezAddams666, I give it Ten Rings!,"Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!Simu Liu is the perfect Marvel protagonist, and Awkwafina delivers the obligatory yet welcomed dose of humor you'd come to expect from a Marvel presentation.But beyond that this movie is rich with mythology, adventure, and incredible martial arts combat that cannot be described with another phrase other than breathtaking, to be the introduction of a new character the story is well-written and you feel as if he had been with us from the start,I give this move the 10 it deserves, In Marvel We Trust.",7 September 2021

(Mostly) very well orchestrated fight sequences. Quite enjoyable actually. Felt like Jackie Chan at times.5. The movie has a very good tempo. Action and story development do not feel out of the place.6. Not too many of the typical silly wisecracks. Still quite some but not as ridiculous as some movies.There're some stuff one can pick on like the girlfriend and sidekicks felt a bit out of place, some development was a bit too abrupt, plot too simple and typical etc. But none of these prevented the movie from being a quite enjoyable experience.",7 September 2021

Cast are fantastic Tony Leung the high point for me. At this point to me the film was an easy 8/10Unfortunately, the second half isn't as tight, the story becomes a little too fantastical ending in a god awful CGI mess that has become all too common with the MCU bringing the score down.It's a shame as the first half is generally fantastic, but I don't see myself rushing to see it again now.",9 September 2021

liumike1981, Nearly perfect,"Just came back from the theater. Definitely great movie. Another blockbuster and big win for marvel. Hugely entertaining . It's as good as black panther.Shangchi original story-line is about revenge and blood for blood. Much more serious than other marvel themes. However, the emotions are diluted to the minimum because of his girlfriend Kathy aka awkwafina. I guess that's on purpose. Also Mandarin aka wenwu his father is much less evil than the original. Basically just a powerful guy losing mind for his beautiful wife. Shangchi himself has a funny character as well. So it's become a popcorn movie but still deep with emotions. Best marvel movie since the winter soliderThe only little regret for me is simu Liu's outlook. Man the face only deserves parking cars. I know Jackie Chan is also not good looking but shangchi to me is very handsome guy whose face is at least at the level of Donnie yen. Come on, he's a comic book super hero.It's already making history by breaking record of Labor Day sales of ANY movie, and it's three times more. Actually this movie is very hard to fail. You got Michelle yeoh the female Jackie Chan, tony Leung best actor in HK even China, awkwafina the best Chinese/ Asian American actress, fala Chan very good actress in HK, etc. This is a dream cast like the new Lakers.",9 September 2021

bdark-39123, First movie in years that got me tearing up and getting goose bumps,"I watched a few Marvel movies for the humor and action, and they were never ""great"" movies to me, so I was expecting to like it but nothing else.In the first few minutes the narrator only speaks Chinese with subtitles, which is a change from the usual immediate switch to English. At the first fighting scene I noticed how cool the music was, It's a bit like dubstep? But it really works with the scenery. Morgan Freeman's small role made me laugh, I didn't expect him there.I was also not expecting to see some things that were slightly mentioned during the movie, I really thought they were gonna keep it mysterious even though it's Marvel.I'm glad the comic relief characters weren't all there all the time, weren't the only ones being funny, and more importantly played a big role in the story. That was very pleasant.Of course the acting was great too, and the sad scenes were believable. I rarely see a main character tearing up. I wish they could cry like a normal human would. A lot of movies suffer from the badass-blank-face protagonist, this wasn't totally the case here.Big pro is the lack of forced romance, kissing and whatever. I hate that stuff. The girl always falls in love with the guy but not here (or it's not shown). Though the parents shouldn't have fallen in love either by my standards
The only bit of blood in the movie was really fake looking, but the other 3D animated made up for itOne thing I'm not happy about is how confusing some action scenes are. No idea what's going on, or where the protagonist is going. It slows down for the important hits, but those are typical Marvel action scenes.I also didn't like that the sister was overshadowed and that she forgave so easily.This is closer to a 10 than a 9 so I gave 10. I'm just so happy I felt something while watching a movie. It's been so long!",10 September 2021
Banglagtavc, Good movie,"I have seen it at the premier. 3D is recommended. It seems Marvel is siding toward mystic and magic instead of science. As I am a hardcore marvel fan since my childhood, I liked it. Specially the Bus fight scene. Don't know about casual watchers.",4 September 2021

The special effects department did an amazing job but the movie in general failed to get me hooked.Katy is one very annoying wannabe sidekick.

The cast, for me, just lacks an enormous amount of emotion.But on the other hand, it's nice to see some fresh faces, a new hero, a new beginning. So make with that review what you want.",12 November 2021
thepriceofpayne, The Legend is Now,"Shang-Chi is a character I and many others, know very little about. Which in Marvels case offers up a clean slate to tell a fresh story. I'm happy to say they have delivered. Marvel's newest outing is a Kung-Fu superhero extravaganza, that is fully built on it's action and set pieces. The performances of Simu Liu and Tony Leung stand out amongst the pack and offer a great and rich story for Marvels Cinematic Universe. Though the film can at times feel bogged down by its origin story tropes, the direction of Destin Daniel Cretton, the overall charm of its cast, and story make the film feel fresh and lively. I'm happy to welcome this crew to the ever growing MCU and cannot wait to see what comes next. Hopefully more Shang-Chi!",12 September 2021

rannynm, Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021. By Heather S., KIDS FIRST!",4 September 2021
efimovm, Norm,"Shang-Chi is arguably the most original and entertaining origin story that Marvel's delivered in quite some time. Coming from someone who's slowly starting to get superhero fatigue from both sides of the aisle, this one delivers. It's a spectacle, and has a family drama that feel's Shakespearean at times. In many ways this is how I wanted the live-action version of Mulan to be.",19 January 2022
mrpicky, Fan Service Central,"Good: it has its own tone. Sir Kingsley. Visuals. Fight scenes stronger then before, but not mind blowing in any way.Bad: fan servicing China market way too hard.

mamacosneil, Martial Arts in MCU...... And It works,"Compared to other action/kung fu movies, I think there's more impressive than those fights but even then; it still works. They well introduced martial arts and 10 rings and I'm impressed of how they use it in fights but I kinda want to see the unique powers of each rings (based in the comics). Still, It's entertaining, visually stunning and it's out of the MCU's pattern which is great. However, I'm not convinced of the Mandarin's motives. It kinda lacks evilness ( ""She"" is his weakness and that's why He's been easily manipulated by a beast and that kinda sucks). Everyone's scared of the Mandarin but in this movie they gave him too much of a heart. In spite of that, it is still a Great movie. I Enjoyed it Recommended to everyone.",3 September 2021

mikecalla, Spoilers: Beautiful....but...,"The first part of the first act is awkward due to the inclusion of Awkwafina. While i enjoy her in many other roles, her character here is executed poorly. Sometimes the scene calls for her to react with a little more reality, a little more urgency but you can tell she's staring at green tennis ball. This pops up through the rest of the movie.It just didn't hit the emotional marks enough for me to care. The ending fell in to the usual tropes of too much on-screen mayhem.It is gorgeous. The choreography is spectacular. It's still a fun spectacleIt may, like other MCU flicks, grow on me with repeated viewings.",8 September 2021

sirwillisiv, A solid superhero adventure...,"Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.Although Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there's tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn't feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie.

thevision-44664, Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings,"After a long time, everyone, especially the Marvel Studios' fans has a chance to watch their latest movie in theatres. And to be honest they will be pleased and they SHOULD watch this in theatres. You will get everything you need from a Marvel flick.Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings gives a new look at a new hero. It's fresh and it's entertainment at best. To start with positive aspects, the performance as usual are Good. Marvel never misses their castings. Everyone gave their best. Especially the leads Liu and Lueng. Both portrayed themselves perfectly. I was expecting Awkwafina to be a cringe, but she didn't disappointed. Action just brilliant, flawless. The screenplay is elegant. Seeing what new Marvel is showing and what more is about to come will crave fans and everyone for more. Especially the concept of Ten Rings. The mysticism and spiritual material is displayed brilliantly. Fantasy at it's peak. The CGI is just.. flawless as usual. Works tooo damn neat.The bad aspects of the movie I consider is the Wenvu's (Leung) unsatisfactory agenda. He's clearly a brilliant intimidating villian but with his agenda, he seems nothing but a Delusional guy. The Wong and Abomination arc shown in the trailers fails to deliver any justice. The guy, so they say ""Death Dealer"" was supposed to be a prominent badass, but they wasted his potential. And Marvel can't keep re-using the formula of ""Big Third Act"", ""Good vs. Evil"", with loads of CGI, they have to use and start giving new screenplays for climax. (also the last thing with Katy being sudden Hawkeye in the climax is just.. facepalm. No way they did that!)Nevertheless, the movie works fine. Along with superb cinematography, good direction and decent background score. Go watch this movie, you'll enjoy and have a good time. Must watch. Not a definite Marvel Masterpiece, but works and balances well with Humor and Outstanding Action.Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings: 4/5 Stars.",5 September 2021
roondogbb, Better than most Marvel movies in recent years.,"I've been asking myself, why is it that I didn't really like the avenger movie's? I realized it's because that though the movies can be split up into nearly 5 hours. Each individual character starts to get less and less time as the roster of different characters builds over the years. Therefore watching an origin story movie for me is much more interesting. Focus is on just a few characters and they can shine as the writing aims to let them bloom. Rather tham play second fiddle to more established characters.With that being said, what is Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings movie all about and is this movie worth seeing? The movie at its core is about Shang Chi (Simu Liu), a young man living in San Francisco working at a hotel parking cars with his friend Katy (Awkwafina) very normal one would think until one day while heading home one the bus with his friend Katy, Shang Chi is attacked by a man with a sword for an arm and several other fighters....After the fight there is exposition given to Katy of what happened and that Shang needs to go to Macau in China to rescue his sister Xialing. From there the story begins to open up. The movie itself has amazing and seamless cgi, that bring alternate dimensions to life. The colouring is so beautiful and the design of all the creatures is impeccable. The movie has many comedic moments and isn't super serious, many of these comedic moment come from the excellent Ben Kingsley as the almost random chatacter of Trevor and also Katy who is an excellent charismatic sidekick.Overall this is a great and I like these single character focused movies rather than avenger movies where although the stakes might be higher. Personalities drown each other out and nobody gets over as much as they should.",13 November 2021
ryanmo-35178, What a movie!,"Marvel universe 4. Not watched many of them before and know nothing about this movie before watching, except Tony Leung from our Hong Kong! Plot is always similar, but the fighting on the bus is good. The last scene between the dragoon and monster is also good. And Tony is just so so so smart and handsome!",2 September 2021
Said-D, Surprisingly good,"I was going in with not much fate in this movie, but i got proven wrong. Its something quite fresh and unexpected, some scenes in the first 45 minutes are a bit weak and could be preformed better, the last hour or so is the absolute best. (they could've gone into more details of the rings themselves and they might want to rethink the cast next time) The music on the other hand was okay it was the final battle where the music stood out. The cameos are crazy! I have to give full points to the hair and makeup department and the costume designs, the costumes where awesome! The movie doesn't try hard to be the best...and it doesn't need to because its already pretty good by itself!Marvel did it again!",3 September 2021
nimrod-14908, Waste of space,"Chang-Chi was created in the early 70's in the Bruce Lee craze and quickly died out, as did the kung fu mania in the west. That its been revived now is nothing to do with the marvel universe but a sop to the chinese market by making a westernised version of their standard, over the top, chop socky movies, Hidden tiger, Crouching Dragon style. Seriously, if you like that genre you'll probably like this, but for anyone outside the orient, it's pointless. Just Disneys grasping at cash ratherthan moving a storyline onwards.",9 November 2021
nicolasverdessm, Enjoyable,"Good action, good fighting, good visuals. The obvious comedic relief of the movie was actually a good character, Awkwafina was very enjoyable here. In all this new Marvel movies I always wonder where are all the other super heroes and why are they not helping, but here it makes sence bc is a personal sotry, not an alien invasion or mega mobs.

shivnarang, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is like a poetry in motion.,"This movie is a blast and then some. It is, just like Black Panther was, a Marvel movie and it's own thing at the same time. It brings a much needed freshness to MCU. The story is about Shang-Chi, a Kung Fu fighter, who is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. Is this the same Ten Rings organization from Iron Man and Iron Man 3? I'll let the movie explain.Director Destin Daniel Cretton successfully blends in his culture in the Marvel format, but also keeps it real, authentic and most importantly communicates a very personal story effectively. At the heart of it, this is a movie about a dysfunctional family dealing with their family drama. I'm not going to talk about what the drama is as that will be a spoiler. But with that drama comes some of the best Kung-Fu fights I've seen on the big screen in a long time.Simu Liu as Shang-Chi and Awkwafina as his best friend are well known stars, but after this movie they will be upgraded to superstar status. They were brilliant in the movie and were yin to each other's yang. Where Simu Liu brought the punches, Awkwafina brought. The punchlines. They complimented each other to create the perfect balance. Another character that left an impression on me is Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as Shang-Chi's father. The love-hate relationship between him and Shang-Chi is relatable and just so heartbreaking.Rest of the star cast is also brilliantly casted and this movie has some of the best written supporting characters. The core group consists of Fala Chen as Shang-Chi's mother who is the soul of this movie, Meng'er Zhang as his sister who is just as much of a kick ass as Shang-Chi and Michelle Yeoh as his aunt who becomes his guide and teacher. There is also a surprise character in the movie that I loved, but I am not going to talk about it and spoil it for you guys.This is a Marvel product so you know that the VFX & CGI are industry best. Adding to that are the beautiful Cinematography and the fast paced Camera Work. Each and every fight sequence is meticulously handled and spectacularly choreographed. You have seen some of the bus fight scenes in the trailer, but there are other high stake fight scenes that will also leave you breathless.You knew you were going to watch this movie when it came out. My review is just to tell you that yes, it is everything you expected and wanted it to be. I personally never doubted Kevin Feige. Now go watch this movie and let it knock your socks off.P. S. - This movie has a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene, so make sure you catch those.",5 September 2021
Shadowboy_25cm," Excellent Origin Story with stunning visuals, playful action scenes and surprisingly deep characterization","Shang-Chi's origin story starts with his father Xu Wenwu. Xu Wenwu is one of the many positive aspects, that make this movie such a joy to watch and such a surprising MCU movie: Xu Wenwu as the antagonist is a very complex character, you see his good and understand what motivates him to become the villain in this story.Shang-Chi is a very complex character, too, being drilled by his father to become an assassin by the age of 14 and getting the final mission to avenge the murder of his loving mother. But he got himself a new identity and name in the U. S., earns some money with part-time jobs and enjoys karaoke nights with his girlfriend.Until the past catches up with him and starts a highly enjoyable, action heavy, fantasy Blockbuster with stunning visuals (camera and FX), excellent fight scene choreography, great soundtrack, great chemistry between the actors/characters, a lot of surprises, some asian lore and just a great entertaining story of the MCU.Some references to other MCU movies and stories appear (references to Iron Man part 3 and Doctor Strange part one), but all in all this movie can stand on his own and that's a welcome surprise, too.The makers of this movie did a great job. Can't wait for the sequel.Highly recommended.",8 February 2022
rosemarrym, A total frustration,"Marvel productions are anything but boring. The film had good representation of the Chinese culture and good visuals, but the plot was very indirect, full of gaps and unexplained things, shallow characterising. It's a certain thing until it turns out to be something else the next second. Quick shifts in the plot. A bit of forced comedy too, and the lack of interesting hooks. This is a Marvel disappointment.",8 September 2021
katyayan-, Shang Chi,"Review By Kamal KMarvels new Shang-Chi was a choreographed dance movie disguised as Kung fu with slow paced action scenes and subtle but detailed components that pull a story together a satisfying but inappropriately fast paced manner. Making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out, which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction.The main gripe I have with Shang Chi is how it just so happens that the Jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao.Although the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score.",24 November 2021

Wililjam, One of the best MCU films (IMO),"This movie was a thrill from start to finish, with emotional beats that worked every single time. There wasn't a moment in the film that I didn't think worked, to be honest.The film wrapped itself up incredibly good, with no loose ends, while also teasing the future of the characters introduced in the film. There were some familiar faces in the movie, some that had been spoiled for me.Visuals were top notch, it was colorful, vibrant, coherent and just pure insanity at the third act.It is entertaining, sad, wholesome, and extremely rewatchable. I personally loved every single second of it.",12 November 2021
timothyisathome, a little predectable,"All in all it was a good Marvel movie, not a great one, but still very good and very entertaining. Shaun and Katy were a great best buds duo with some fun interactions. Ben Kingsley's reprise as the Mandarin was hysterical. He's got such range and doesn't take himself too seriously and that makes him perfect.Great fight scenes, ok origin story, but a little predictable unfortunately.Hopefully the next movie will get a little more attention to keeping the audience guessing at least a little.Watch and enjoy, even if you see it coming.",5 January 2022
LumosX," After the painful, painful opening: passable but overrated visual spectacle and a waste of talented cast members","A friend saw this shortly after it came out and said he wouldn't mind rewatching it, leaving me rather surprised. A couple of days later another friend dragged us out to see this, at a 4dx screening, no less. I got burnt out on capeshit after ""Ant-Man"", but this looked possibly interesting enough to be enjoyable.Aside from the overwhelming shaking of the 4dx chairs, the film itself is a plothole-ridden nonsensical mess, led by unlikeable characters and a complete waste of its two most famous cast members, Ben Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh. As can be anticipated from modern high-budget films, it's also laden with impressive CGI and good-looking visuals, and the monsters are cool. It's just a shame that it's such a waste. The ratings must be artificially inflated as well, as there's no way anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature would actually think this is a good film. But let's get into some more details.Starting from the opening, we're introduced to our unremarkable protagonist and the annoying female lead. ""Katy"" is as useless, annoying, infantile, and uncharismatic as one could imagine. I couldn't have written a more grating character if I tried. On top of her, we're given some very awkward, stilted dialogue that was probably supposed to be cutesy or something, but fails dramatically. After the end of the first act, which terminates with the bus sequence, the film becomes slightly more palatable. Instead of cringing and facepalming and wondering why, exactly, I'd spent £16 on this trash, I could at least watch the thing.Then we get into the nonsensical. After his mother got killed by the mob, Shang-Chi trained hard for years before getting sent to avenge her death. He killed her murderer, but then decided to feel bad, run away to the US and abandon his ten-year-old sister whom he loved, after telling her he'd be back in three days. His sister, who ""taught herself better"" just by watching the real fighters train, ran away 6 years later and founded an underground fighting ring in Macau all by herself with no money or support from anyone. Right. Shang-Chi's dad didn't actually want to kill his kids when he sent his mercs to fight them (including the big guy with the blade-hand), he actually wants his children's help to find their mum, who's allegedly still alive. They run away from the dad, stealing some BMW hatchback instead of a Land Rover or a Jeep for a trip into the Chinese outback. Conveniently, the car's turn circle happens to be just the one needed to traverse a perilous ""living"" forest maze that ""eats"" stragglers. Our heroes find the late mum's village, train for ONE day, and defeat all evil, including the dangerous merc army bent on burning the village down.Nothing in the paragraph above, and little in the film in general, makes any sense, including the fact that the bad guys show up to the village---the village they want to slaughter the population of---with stun batons and shock crossbows. I guess assault rifles wouldn't have quite stood up to the good guys' ""dragon-forged"" staves. Katy, the annoying American-born character who looks significantly out of shape, trains archery for a handful of hours before letting a much cooler character get his soul sucked out (RIP Master Guang Bo, I'll remember you) before landing the single lucky arrow needed to dispatch the eldritch boss-monster from half a kilometre away. She'd never be able to draw a real bow, let alone hit any target at all.Shang-Chi himself also trains for a few hours before defeating his dad and his rings against all odds, but the flashbacks showing him training with his mum as a kid at least allow me to suspend disbelief sufficiently to go with it. What I can't go with is the fact that Shang-Chi takes a full ring-empowered gut punch beforehand, which propels him some fifty metres, and would have ruptured his spleen or stomach. He's dead, Jim. I don't care about your plot armour.The final sequence also included so much seat shaking (4dx) that I could barely follow what was going on with the eldritch monster. 4dx was fine in ""Alita: Battle Angel"", but whoever the poor sod responsible for programming this film's effects was, he must have been out of his mind.The worst part of this is that the story has potential and could have been handled better if someone actually tried to make it logical. What, am I supposed to ""turn my brain off""? I can't ""turn my brain off"" because I actually have one. As a writer, I'd be laughed out of the room if I were to write a script as nonsensical as this. Guess that doesn't apply to blockbusters for some reason...Michelle Yeoh is completely wasted in an insignificant role as Shang-Chi's aunt. Ben Kingsley is back as his ""Iron Man 3"" role, a dumb Englishman theatre actor providing comic relief alongside Katy; a role that I recall people perceived as an insult to the character of the Mandarin when ""Iron Man 3"" came out. The sole difference between his and Katy's jokes is that I actually chuckled at a couple of his.A 4.5 is what I'd give, and I'd probably round it up to a 5, as the visual spectacle is decent, albeit dragged way down by the sheer inanity of the script. This unnaturally high rating, however, merits rounding mine down. I can't accept the rating is real. If it is, then people must be too willing to slobber up all the flashy corporate sludge thrown their way, which would be saddening.",23 September 2021
ron592, Something to look forward to ..,"Yet to watch The Eternals and the new crop of characters into the MCU, but this is one I would definitely look forward to going forward ! Wonderful CGI apart , a comprehensive origin movie that blends well into the MCU.",16 November 2021
jliao27, Wonderful,"I had read the advance reviews and was excited about the positivity and glowing feedback I'd seen. It means a lot to Asian-Americans to finally be put in the spotlight, and by a juggernaut like the Marvel machine no less.Went to see a late night showing on Thursday, Sept 2nd, technically a day in advance of the official release date. Happy to say the movie did not disappoint. I've watched so many Hong Kong style movies over the years and the Shang-Chi film-making team did a spectacular job of importing that authentic, Asian-flavor of film-making. They did the kind of research I've come to expect from Marvel's creative team, and let this team leave their own distinct Chinese style from using Mandarin-speaking dialogue in strategic moments, to the very distinct style of Chinese-influenced music (totally awesome!), and the kung-fu sequences on the scaffolding, which is something you see in many of the old school Kung Fu movies. Michelle Yeoh, in particular, acted in many a movie in this vein back many years ago.The filmmakers did a great job of melding old-style, Authentic Chinese Kung Fu cinema and themes (father-son tension, motherly devotion, male prioritized over female, etc .) with current Asian-American themes (underachieving children and over-expecting parents, general confusion in American society) and combining everything in the context of a fantasy-action movie with trademark Marvel humor to lighten things up.I was a fan of the special effects throughout the movie, and thoroughly enjoyed the ending sequence as well. Like other reviewers, I loved the opening fight sequence between Tony Leung and Fala Chen. It's wonderful to see that Tai Chi - style of fighting introduced in a Western, blockbuster movie.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a great movie but with Shang-Chi, I think Marvel achieved something more in melding disparate parts and taking on much more in bringing together cultures, generations and viewpoints in the context of a MCU superhero action movie. The next time we see Shang-Chi, there's no doubt most of us - moviegoers of all colors and cultures - we will be happy to see him again.",3 September 2021
salfmus, Too Fakey for Martial Art Fans.,"I watched this movie because people praised the action scenes but seriously, you have to be a complete martial art movie noob to be impressed by this stuff. Most of the scenes are obviously fake and full of CGI. The fun thing about martial art stuff is to watch actual athletes doing crazy stuff. You see with this movie that the main character isn't a skilled martial artist to begin with and it becomes embarrassingly obivious with the fight scene with Michelle Yeoh, who is an actual talented fighter. They had to cut multiple times and add CGI magic to make him look good. They lost me completely when they started to go crazy on cartoon fantasy and cheap chinese lore. It's a dull and generic movie for people who have watched a lot of asian movies. I give 4 because at least it's not woke.",13 November 2021

With all the rave reviews coming out I felt like I was going to see another blockbuster like Avengers End Game. Boy was I wrong. The movie had some pretty visuals and some ok dancing type action sequences, but that gets a little old halfway through the movie. The lead actor and the villain have the charisma of a ""wooden plank."" I found myself trying to stay awake and make sense of the non sensical plot, and big battle in the forest near the end with the dragons that come out of nowhere. Bottom line, I'd say this would be a perfect free on demand movie you can catch at home, or maybe Redbox.",17 November 2021

othershinhadi, Tony Leung makes the movie,"Tony Leung elevates this movie to where it has no business being. As soon as the last shot of his last scene you feel the change in the atmosphere as the movie goes back to applying the same MCU formula we've all seen. It's fine if that's what you watch the movie for, but for other people like me I've seen enough of it to not still want more of the same. If Marvel movies were noodles, they all taste pretty much the same for me. But this one gives a special ingredient that you can't help notice make it so different from the other noodles in the menu. That ingredient is Tony Leung.Besides that, the story has considerably more depth than your usual Marvel movies. It touches the subject of families, and how they're important whether or not you like them.I'd be surprised if any Shang-Chi sequels would top this anytime soon. Tony Leung is one of a kind.",6 April 2022
allanjiang, A new age for Marvel. Visually stunning.,"This was a powerful film for Asians everywhere, as Marvel takes into an era of inclusion and expansion.Story wise, Shang Chi was good, not great, but solid. Displays Asian values perfectly. I found a few of the Chinese lines irritating to hear, as a native Mandarin speaker.The martial arts sequences were simply amazing. Fights scenes were captivating and beautiful, with superb special affects on top of the actual martial arts. With the Eternals coming up, Marvel is clearly upping its CGI and special affects making much more cinematographic films.My only complaint was the ending, went from one of Marvel's best into Godzilla.

kaden_lewis, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"This movie was great, it was entertaining, it was fast paced, and it was unique. There were so many things I liked about this film. First off, I loved all the characters, such as Shang-Chi, Katy, Xu Wenwu, Xialing, Razor Fist, Death Dealer, the return of Trevor Slattery, Morris, and of course Master Guang Bo. The actors for all these characters were also perfect. They suited their roles perfectly. In my opinion, this movie had some of the best supporting characters in the MCU. I also loved the action. It was absolutely amazing, there were some points in the movie where I felt like I was watching a martial arts movie. The stunts and the choreography were perfect, I couldn't have asked for anything more. The effects in this movie were also stunning. The moving forest, the mythical creatures (especially the dragon), and the effects used on the Ten Rings were super cool. The effects in this movie were some of the best in the MCU. Lastly, I also loved the plot, it just sat really well with me.This movie was like nothing we have ever seen before in the MCU. It was very unique and a nice twist for Marvel. The first Credit Scene was also very interesting and might have set up phase 4 in the MCU. This was a great movie, and I definitely recommend going to see it, even if you aren't a Marvel fan.",16 September 2021
romanluu, Manage your expectations?,"This movie is not for everyone.I would like to preface this by saying that I was really thrilled to have an Asian superhero on the big screen. The trailers looked fantastic and I was hoping Marvel/Disney could supplement the visuals and fight choreographies with a good storyline well set into the preexisting MCU.Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.The visuals are stunning as expected. The fight scenes are great too. But the story is a mixed bag.It starts off as a family drama between Shang-Chi, his father and his sister. That would all be good and indeed it was, I really enjoyed the first half or so of the movie. Even despite the main villain (or supposedly the main one at that point in the story) being a bit bland in my opinion, certainly for a 1000-year-old conqueror and mastermind wielding incredibly powerful artifacts of unknown origin (sidenote: the rings turn out to not do much beside being hurled at enemies like projectiles with cool light effects; in other words their powers are really not explored or represented well at all).The second half (when they discover the mystical village) is when things go absolutely bonkers. If the story kept revolving around the family of the protagonist, it would be all good. But for whatever reason someone decided to throw a complete oddball into the movie in a form of soul-eating demons (?) which, without much explanation or backstory (the only thing we know about them is that they exist), instantly assume the role of the main bad against whom everyone (including the previous main villain and his henchmen) must fight. At this point I was just sitting there amazed by the visuals and absolutely confused by what was actually happening as I wasn't sure if the main fight was Shang-Chi against his dad, Shang-Chi against the soul-eating demon, The Great Protector dragon against the demon, Shang-Chi, his sister and his friend Katy against the demon...you get the point.The camoes of other MCU characters also felt forced. Wong was fighting Abomination, sure, but why? We never find out and it's hinted that they are actually pals. Does that mean Secretary Ross just occasionally misplaces Abomination for friendly sparring with a sorcerer then? Captain Marvel and Bruce Banner also appear, briefly examining the rings which apparently have some kind of a beacon in them. Again, completely out of nowhere but perhaps a promise for the next movie where we might actually find our what the hell is going on with these things (which again seem only as a collection of cool deadly mini frisbees in the movie).Am I glad that I went to watch it in a cinema? Yes. Do I think the character has a lot of potential for the future movies? Absolutely. But as of right now, Shang-Chi has been one of the most underwhelming introductions of a new superhero within the MCU to date.",2 September 2021

shampyon, One of the best MCU entries so far,"Xu Wenwu might just be Marvel's best villain. He has done unforgivable things, but motives are entirely sympathetic. The movie does a great job of showing him as a human being and not just some agent of evil. Part of that is the writing, but a huge chunk of the credit goes to Tony Leung's performance.All of the performances are top-notch. Despite taking place in such a heightened reality, they all feel very grounded and human. The friendship and love between Shang-Chi and Katy in particular feels completely natural, especially in those scenes at her home in San Francisco.Hong Kong action films have a reputation for a kind of creativity that a lot of Hollywood films lack. Traditionally a Hollywood fight scene could change it's setting, or the people in it, and you wouldn't notice a difference, because they're planned without taking the character or environment into account. In Hong Kong action they use the character's clothes, everyday objects, parts of the environment, so that particular fight could only have taken place with those particular characters in those particular environments. Hollywood's gotten better at it over the years, and Shang-Chi is a wonderful example. You couldn't transplant that bus fight between Shang-Chi and Razorfist onto a dock, or swap out Razorfist for Bushwacker. They also go all-in on the balletic Wuxia style fight choreography, with water and leaves and other elements of the environment flowing along with the fighter's movements.Like all MCU films, it drags a bit in the tail end with it's very long battle filled with CGi performances. The use of large empty arenas - the gate platform, the lake, the sky - makes it feel a little less grounded, and a little more Hollywood than the other battle scenes. It would have been nice for them to have some more distinct features for the characters to interact with - statuary like the story wall shown earlier in the film, for example. An especially wasted opportunity for the parts of the battle taking place in the village, which was full of architecture and decoration that could have been put to creative use. But there's still enough quality fight choreography to keep you interested.There's also a couple of fun post-credits sequences - I was already all-in on any Shang-Chi sequels, but these were wonderful teasers for what may be coming.",13 November 2021

stephen_the_immortal, Far better than expected,"I thought I'd like the film, but I didn't expect it to be one of my all-time favorite MCU movies! It's a mix of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and anything Jackie Chan. The action in this movie is as good as you've read, and easily the best action in any MCU film to date. Simu Liu is awesome, but the ending is so epic it's definitely worth the price of admission. As an English teacher I loved the self-aware reference to Macbeth, but the film does a fantastic job completing the hero's journey. Great job Marvel, you've done it yet again.",4 September 2021
MovieWarfare, The All Asian cast movie we have all been waiting for,"I once said after watching Black Panther, that it would be cool if there was an all Asian cast similar to it. There were some all Asian cast movies like Crazy Rich Asian (2018), but that is a romcom, and Mulan (2020), but that was bad. In comes Shang Chi which is the first Asian lead Superhero movie ever. The premise is ""Martial-arts master Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) confronts the past he thought he left behind when he's drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization"". So does Shang Chi succeed in giving us a good all Asian cast big blockbuster or is it just another failed attempt?Firstly, the action sequences and choreography are some of the best from Marvel since Captain America and the Winter Soldier (2014). Martial arts are the focus of the action scenes in Shang Chi and they are beautifully choreographed. We get the classic wire-fu/floating style of Crouching Tiger but we also get some Jackie Chan style with the utilization of the environment for the action. Each action scene is memorable and stunning to watch. Additionally, the action scenes avoid using lots of cuts and shaky cam which I was so grateful for. It is also clear that the actors themselves rehearsed the choreography making the fights feel more believable and gratifying. It does become a more typical MCU action sequence by the third act but even that is still pretty enjoyable even if it isn't as good as the first two acts.The cinematography by Bill Pope (Matrix trilogy, Spiderman 2 and 3, Scott Pilgrim) is also excellent in Shang Chi. Skyscrapers and forests in Marvel movies have never looked as good as it has in Shang Chi. Bill pope and director Destin use the lighting and colours very effectively and allow for some genuinely beautiful shots. The music score by Joel P. West is also pretty good. Joel utilizes more electronic sounds and pop/rap songs for the scenes in the city but uses more traditional Asian instruments for the mystical areas. Joel's score captures the scene and the pop/rap songs themselves are also quite good albeit not as memorable as the Weeknd or Lamar from Black Panther. I also love the story and exploration of ""family"" with Shang Chi whilst not using Asian stereotypes. It also doesn't overuse humour like in Marvel's previous outing, Black Widow (2021), where they use jokes every couple of minutes and ruin a serious scene. Shang Chi thankfully avoids doing this, thus allowing the emotion of a scene to linger longer. There are still jokes though but they are genuinely quite funny.Furthermore, Simu Liu is charismatic, charming and cool as the titular character Shang Chi. I think Marvel succeeds again in the casting department as Simu Liu delivers on making me believe that this guy is a top tier martial artist. I also think Simu gives a good performance during the more emotional moments as well. His chemistry with Awkwafina who plays Shang Chi's friend Katy is great too. The banter between Shang Chi and Katy is some of the funniest scenes and makes me believe that those two were friends for years. However, Tony Leung who plays the main villain Wenwu (the real Mandarin) is the one that steals the show. Tony Leung is just phenomenal as he can convey the exact emotions of his character just through body language alone, it is just masterful acting. My biggest worry with MCU origin movies is that the villains are lacklustre but Shang Chi does not fall into this. Wenwu is very sympathetic but also extremely fearsome. He is also the father of Shang Chi which makes the conflict between them feel more meaningful and tragic. Wenwu is not a straight-up evil person as he does still have good in him and I like that.Unfortunately, Shang Chi suffers from having the 3 villain problem. Razorfist played by Florian is Wenwu's henchman and he doesn't get any backstory. I don't mind him that much though as he is mostly there to chase Shang Chi like a 007 henchman. There is also a scene where he does seem visibly worried about Wenwu's health which gives him some character depth. On the other hand, the 3rd villain Death Dealer who is a mysterious assassin of Wenwu is a massive disappointment. He looks very cool and visibly distinct from other ten ring members and is relevant to Shang Chi's past but amounts to absolutely nothing.Moreover, there is also a 3rd hero to Shang Chi and Katy with Shang Chi's sister Xialing played by Meng'er Zhang. She doesn't get enough interactions with Shang Chi, Katy or her father Wenwu and that feels like a waste. It's a shame as her interactions with both Shang Chi and Katy are enjoyable and she also doesn't interact with her dad Wenwu which is just a missed opportunity for her character. The movie also has a pacing issue as it slows down significantly in the second act. It just featured a lot of talking, exposition and flashbacks which I felt could have been cut down by a couple of minutes.Overall, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the all Asian cast movie I have been waiting for. It delivers on the action, story and characters while being an exciting new addition to the MCU. I can't wait to see more of Shang Chi and finally get to see an Asian in the Avengers team.",4 September 2021
andres_ge88, Absolutely loved it! Please Go watch it!,"Shang Chi movie Review
No spoilers
Oh wow! I really loved this film! It really went above and beyond my expectations. To tell you the truth I had no idea of how it would play out. As a matter of fact I am pretty good at predicting this but this movie really had me guessing. I highly recommend to watch this film. Of course it's a Disney Film so it gave vibes similar to Mulan and of course it's an Oriental film so it gave vibes of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. And of course it's a Marvel Comics film but this isn't your regular Marvel movie. I highly recommend you to watch it if you haven't already. You are going to love it. Trust me. This is worth every penny.",6 September 2021
e_lisa369, quite a disappointment,"I am surprised all those ""suspicious"" good review, i m falling asleep and can't even pay attention most of the time. Somehow the mandarin in the movie is weird, is like watching an incrediblely old chinese movie trying to hit international with a bunch of westerners in the movie. This is by far the worst of MCU movies... some of the chinese cast doesn't even speak Mandarin/English as mother language, the languages in the movies is quite irritating while they keep swapping in between both languages or may be marvel doesn't care the way they speak does effect the experience while the audience watch it. I guess the best scene is just the action part and the CG without anyone talking....",10 November 2021
Zinaidafel, Legend...,"The film ""Shang chi and the legend of the Ten Rings"" is quite dynamic, there are a lot of special effects.The film combines science fiction, fantasy, action, adventure. I like such films, because you immediately tune in to miracles and the unreality of events.The elements of humor in the film are also visible, there are funny moments.The plot of the film is interesting, in my spirit, the only thing missing was a smoother transition of an ordinary fighter into a superhero, as the reincarnation happened quickly.The film is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton. The film itself is from the USA and Australia. Marvel Studios. The film lasts more than two hours, but it looks in one breath.The plot jumps into the past in periods, revealing the biography of the hero.Summing up, I want to say the film was very interesting to watch and not boring. A very beautiful fairy tale movie. There was a little lack of plot revealing moments, though then it would have stretched for all three hours, if not more, but for me it would have been better to let it stretch.Therefore , I advise you to look !",19 January 2022

bosporan, Beautifully rendered above average martial arts movie.,"The prologue is beautiful but drawn out and redundant. Initially we meet car valet Simu Liu as Shaun reprising his role as Jung from Kim's Convenience. It is difficult to see past him as this character, intelligent but drifting in life, until the inevitable first fight which is extraordinarily well choreographed, much better than most of the subsequent fights. The main plot elements are dull, daddy issues, resentful sister, side-kick jester girlfriend. This and the main arc (magic collectibles) are vehicles upon which to hang the fabulous cgi vistas, effects and gratuitous violence. In-the-round an enjoyable watch, but nowhere near the promotional hype nor the 'best movie ever' hysteria.",2 April 2022
taranpannu01, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021),"Marvel recruits indie director Destin Daniel Cretton of Short Term 12 fame to bring the character of Shang Chi to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Sadly, an abundance of familiar tropes, messy visual effects and a lead character who is overshadowed both by performance and development from the villain leads to a painfully average film.Shang Chi follows all the needed and formal tropes to make a surprisingly dull origin tale. Simu Liu is fine in the role of Shang Chi who must challenge his father from unleashing a terrible foe.Tony Leung makes his English language debut as Wenwu, a far more compelling and intriguing character then his son, with Leung giving a refreshingly subtle performance.Awkwafina is fine as Shang Chi's friend Katy but her generic arc lets her down. Meng'er Zhang plays Shang Chi's sister, Xialing who is also far more interesting then her titular brother but lacks the screentime to really be fleshed out.The ensemble do solid work with notable standouts being Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen with a very funny Ben Kingsley and a much welcomed Benedict Wong.The film soars during the rather intimate scenes between Wenwu and his wife Leiko but these scenes are soon traded for large scale battles with ugly green screen backgrounds.Aside from some intriguing post credits scenes, the film leaves you wanting more. It's a shame that Marvel didn't allow Cretton to make use of his indie sensibilities and resigned him to a basic origin tale that is painfully average.",7 November 2021

daviddeng-59268, Good VFX but incoherent and cliché,"Shang Chi has a hallmark of being a big budget film, but it missed the mark in its attempt to be simultaneously an Asian martial arts film and a marvel film.On the positive side, the animations and the choreography are really well-done, and they demonstrate significant amount of planning and thought. However, the film lacks coherence as it intertwines sharply opposing scenes from a fight club in Macau to a peaceful fantasy Chinese village to downtown San Francisco. Comedy is used to punctuate the film, but they feel very out of place in a movie about a Chinese American aiming to kill his father, an idea that is so opposed to the ordinary Chinese-American worldview that the film should deserve more gravity. The costumes evoke a feeling of the characteristically ineffective attempt by Hollywood to mix Eastern and Western styles. In the village scene, bright artificially-coloured clothes contrast with the natural objects surrounding them (wood statues, old temples, trees, and magical creatures).Additionally, the movie is somewhat cliché, unrealistic, and illogical. The back story is one involving a long-vanquished evil threatening to come back, and the true vanquisher of such evil already lays under a a lake and (presumably) would have prevented the evil from coming back even without the protagonist's help. The side character predictably must be the one who saves the village at the critical moment despite having no prior training in archery whatsoever. Have I become too grown up to appreciate such a storyline? Marvel cannot simply hide its shoddy plot work by pre-empting the critics in the bar scene. Every major scene in the movie have significant similarity with some previous movies. The fight ring was in spiderman; the village was in Kungfu Panda; Fights in buses and scaffoldings have been done countless of times before.So what's new? What makes this movie special? On a martial arts standpoint, it pales in comparison to Tony Leung's previous films. On an ""Asian empowerment"" standpoint, it lacks authenticity and its fantastical nature prevents any serious message from being conveyed. Indeed, the viewers are left wondering whether this movie champions the family or the freedom from it.The characters development is also lackluster. They were the ones who scorn social expectations and the ones who wish to have fun. How did they transition to people who will risk their lives to protect a village?Overall, Shang-Chi seems to disappoint.5/10.",5 September 2021

hunter-friesen," ""Shang-Chi"" Brings Balance to the MCU","For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . ""Black Panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn't have to be so beige. ""Captain Marvel"" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with ""Black Panther"", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton's material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu's comedic instincts light up the room.Veteran Tony Leung brings the same melancholic energy to Wenwu as he did in his roles with Wong Kar-wai, particularly his work in ""In the Mood for Love."" Leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator. He carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion, two things that have made some of the greatest villains.The overall narrative within a Marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action. Thankfully, Cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre, taking after such films as Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (also starring Michelle Yeoh) and Zhang Yimou's ""House of Flying Daggers."" The action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue, particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence. But there's also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower-scaffolding brawl where Shang-Chi's emotions turn him into a raw killer. Not since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level.When allowed to be its own film, ""Shang-Chi"" is quite the spectacle. But when it gets forcefully molded into a Marvel film, the results are less than stellar. Even after all his work with the story and action, Cretton can't break free from the third-act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice. It's a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes. Being that this is the 25th film in the franchise, I've come to expect that level of disappointment.Thanks to its multi-talented cast and crew, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action may (rightfully) be the selling point, but the heart of the film lies within its characters, telling a familiar story on an impressive scale.",10 September 2021

SoumikBanerjee25, One of the most Emotionally Charged Superhero Movies made in recent times.,"Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.I'm not even exaggerating, I have been a follower of Marvel since my teenage days, suffice it to say, Through many ups and downs I keenly witnessed all of their works over the years. Trust me when I say that they have very much revamped their strategy this time around.Excluding their typical set-up for a Comicbook blockbuster, Shang-Chi's familial/dramatic aspects are on an all-time high here. The way this story has been told, it just feels somewhat distinctive and special (Especially, compared to the last few projects Marvel has had come up with).Other than the apparent masteries in its Audio-Visual departments (as expected); the narrative here infuses a powerful statement, a different outlook on family & self-acceptance. And guess what? It never sounded preachy nor pretentious; not for a single moment.Another praiseworthy characteristic is the Action sequences or to be precise, all the Choreography behind! An incredible show for the Martial Arts fans and yeah FYI Simu Liu (Shang-Chi); our primary protagonist did most of his stunts, all by himself; that is amazing Isn't it?Pretty much the same impression applies to all the other members of the ensemble; however, I do have some serious reservations about their respective character depictions.To start with, Shang-Chi's estranged father (Played by a veteran, Tony Leung Chiu-wai);
The writing on his character felt a bit detached and incoherent! Don't know about you, but for the most part, I was rather uncertain about what should I exactly feel about this guy! Should I be sympathetic or furious about the choices he had made? Gotta say this dilemma got the better of me.Furthermore, the Mother of Shang-Chi (Played by Fala Chen) from Ta-Lo; I do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! Just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! Other than that, she, herself was pretty great in there. No complaints whatsoever. And Oh yeah, Nora Lum or Awkwafina (The Name, majority of you might know her by). She was terrific in her role as well; the much-needed comic relief in such a sob story!In a nutshell, I must admit, this was a rather unprecedented gamble from Marvel and It did pay off quite well in the end. To be honest, I couldn't be more pleased about that! As I see it, these Superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators, and when it gets backed up by the Big Studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top.",23 November 2021

This movie is like that. Not too many side plots, no going down the rabbit hole trying to keep up with this and that. This was a straight story line with great character building. While there is a ton of CGI I felt it wasn't overly done; it was used when needed and was not overbearing. I have to give props the Awkwafina, as well. She did a great job keeping up with the heavily driven scenes. She was still her funny self but she knew when to pull back on her signature funny schitck and played out the serious/low key scenes to perfection.

Wong is terrific and appears to be setting up sequels and future interactions / crossovers with perhaps Doctor Strange and others. Same for the late-credit scene.

imanib-36810, Fala Chen's Character Saves This Dud,"I was excited to see this film even before it materialized into actual being. I remember thinking, ""This is going to be the next Black Panther experience...but with Asian representation!!!!"". I was so pumped to meet Shang Chi and watch his story unfold. And then...it got here. And I saw it yesterday and was SO SO SO disappointed. I found story telling bland and CGI filled, the action meh, dialogue rehashed from other films (especially the humor), and most of the characters one dimensional and non interesting (especially Shang)...but there WAS some heart in this movie. The Marvel movies at least have that at the end of the day. Even the misses have SOMETHING good about it. For most of the Thor movies it was Loki. For Captain America's first film it was Cap's overall goodness. And for Black Widow it was the introduction of her not-so sister. I found this movie heart to be none other than...the mother. Yes. I'm going to write that Fala Chen who played the mother of Shang Chi is the ONLY great part about this film. Honestly, she should have been Shang Chi herself and should be in the MCU alone. Because she STOLE THE SHOW. I wish we could have just gotten her story and her character, because it was WAY more interesting than anything that this film was trying to do. So, I feel like I didn't waste my money buying a ticket because I at least got to fall in love with the mother character and her story. But other than that, I'd say this was a miss overall and is NOT giving Phase Four a hopeful look for the future :/",4 September 2021

DodicoReviews, Crouching Tiger meets Marvel,"Below average martial art flick and falls short as a super hero film. Most of the movie isn't in English. First act was promising, 2nd act boring, last act saved the movie from an absolute fail. Character development was weak. No build up for the fight scenes, not enough conflict, dull storyline/protagonist/plot.Can't really say much good about this film. Seemed to miss every mark. Had a few promising moments, not enough build up to any meaningful conflict, hard to stay invested when half the movie isn't in English. The fight scenes weren't great.

ryfin, Mixed Bag of Fun,"I enjoy some traditional Kung-Fu movie choreography, I love the idea of adding some Asian culture into the MCU, and this movie was looking to be pretty good especially after I saw so many positive reviews. In the end, I have mixed feelings:This movie has plenty to love: Simu Liu and Awkwafina carry this movie, both being very cute and funny with good acting. There is some good choreography early on. The lore of the world is interesting.Unfortunately, there is quite a lot I didn't care for. The run time is really long for the content you're getting: my gf was asleep for the last hour. A lot of the reason for the run time is the heavy exposition. The dad is an okay villain, and I wish that I felt more of the tension between him and Shang. Shang's sister didn't add anything for me personally, which is surprising because I have a little sister that I did not see for a long portion of my life and then reconnected with, so I thought that I would be able to connect to their struggle. The final half hour with all of the giant CGI monsters just did not feel right for this movie. Watching a giant dragon fight a giant demon felt pretty over the top, and I am still confused as to where all of this lore fits in with what we already know about the MCU.There was a lot to like and a lot that took me out of the movie, which sucks because I really wanted to love this movie. It is definitely not bad and I would love to see more of this in the MCU with a little bit of refining. Overall, I don't see myself choosing to watch this movie again.",15 November 2021

shefali-59244, Shang Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings Is A Strong Step Forward For The MCU,"There is an instant thrill in having a supersized Marvel superhero movie begin with a voiceover in Mandarin as Tony Leung comes into the frame. One of the world's great actors, Leung exerts an effortless majesty. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, he plays Wenwu - an immortal who possesses 10 rings with enormous occult power. Wenwu, also known as The Mandarin, heads a criminal organisation called The Ten Rings, which was introduced in the first Iron Man movie. He is a man tormented by an insatiable lust for power, which somehow gets submerged under his love for his wife but then resurfaces after her death as something even more twisted and vicious. Wenwu is one of the more tragic villains in the MCU and Leung plays him with a melancholic charisma that doesn't let up even in the climax as several CGI creatures twist and snarl and prey on everything in their path. He is one of the many pleasures of this film.Read the full review on Film Companion.",7 September 2021

There are a lots of nice looking locations and colors in the film, and it has a nice Asian feel to it. There are also great quiet scenes between Shaung and his family. The characters are great, Shaung and his sister being warriors with troubled lives, their father being determined to bring back his wife back despite what his son says, and Katy, Trevor and Morris are all really hilarious. Also, the movie is just fun to watch. I largely reccomend it.",5 September 2021

DmytroBaker, Oriental martial arts entered Marvel,"The introduction of new superheroes into the cinematic universe has always been accompanied by reactions from the audience. People who are not familiar with comics take a long time to adapt to new characters on the screen. There was a time when not everyone knew even Thor. The Guardians of the Galaxy have been cleverly introduced with humor to further develop their inherent style of comedy and adventure. But what about Asian rental? After all, the profit of the Middle Kingdom brings a lot, so the director Destin Daniel Cretton raised the comics from the dusty shelf.Before us seems to be a typical Marvel movie, but after the large-scale ""The Avengers"" it is perceived dryly and narrowly. Easter eggs, of course, are shooting from everywhere. Yes, a few cameos will pleasantly delight fans, but if the tape had been separately about Shang-Chi and the legend, and not with a postscript to the MCU, it would have turned out much better. To seed the plot, the opening story of the ten rings serves as an explanation of the artifact and a representation of the antagonist.The amusement ride introduces us to Shang-Chi and his girlfriend Katie. While the introduction of the characters is accompanied by routine episodes, leading to a showdown in the kung fu style in order to somehow entice, there is no excitement inherent in KVM films. The story of the return to his homeland, the fight against the ghosts of the past and the clouding of the mind of the main villain give the journey and disclosure of the hero. Constant flashbacks somehow clarify the situation, hence the uncomfortable perception.It was unexpected to meet Emil Blonsky - aka Abomination. Thirteen years have passed since The Incredible Hulk, and now we meet again. Such vivid and colorful underground battles between the heroes complement this story with a general view of the universe after Thanos' snap. To add Shang-Chi to the magic branch of the CME, Wong meets us with his portal rings. The fight against the past and the disclosure of an ancient legend is accompanied by drama, regular flashbacks and a funny play on Mandarin and the events of the third ""Iron Man"". Actually, Trevor Slattery visited the plot of this MCU series.The picture tries to ascribe all the events already known, either playfully playing on previous films, then approaching the new artifact with all seriousness. The key location, which both reveals the prophecy and explains the legend of ancient evil, sends us to Narnia. Seriously, a magical land with fantastic creatures (Newt Scamander has already left) refers to all family, adventure films about the struggle between good and evil. In addition to the Chronicle of Narnia, we have here ""Bridge to Terabithia"", ""Spiderwick: The Chronicles"", ""Inkheart"", ""Jumanji"", but not like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. An epic fight at the end - as it should be, demonstrating the power of the rings and setting yourself on the path of a warrior.Entertainment, which is set to show action, a magical world, battles and acceptance of your past. No sense of connection with previous films. Despite the references and cameos, the film should be taken as an individual project. The post-credits scene already reveals familiar faces and attributes ten rings to common magical artifacts in Kamar Taj.Actor Simu Liu looked simple and new. If, for example, the first performance of Doctor Strange was accompanied by the already familiar Benedict Cumberbatch, then Shang-Chi does not boast of this. The target audience has already thinned noticeably. In addition, the eternal problem of the MCU is raised - no one knew about the threat, except for the heroes of the new picture. Okay Nick Fury (or Skrulls), but the Ancient One, Doctor Strange? Such a massive threat, which actually had to somehow react to Thanos' click. In general, we are again stepping on the same rake, ignoring our own rules.",29 November 2021
elhonig-902-129896, Totally entertaining...,"A very fun and engrossing movie, tied in with the Avengers and MCU. Great CGI with spectacular effects that should probably be seen on a big screen with big sound. Partly serious storyline, with Awkwafina adding some comedy, but also she was surprisingly good as an essential character who evolves into someone more than just the comic relief . There were some plot holes, and a few things that require the viewer to suspend a little logic, but overall a great movie to watch. Looking forward to seeing these characters again.",20 November 2021

subxerogravity, The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fuIts a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.",4 September 2021

After the 1st half is done.. the movie went downhill.. It could have been better but still it was decent.. Anyways Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings serves the purpose of entertainment and we can say that Marvel Studios never disappoint us with their movies..7.7/10 ⭐",5 September 2021
dbdsmfv, Logical inconsistency,"OK The wearer of the rings can defeat entire armies.But she can beat him.But, she gets killed by a gang of thugs.*That, if it is to be plausible, did not seem to get an enduring explanation of any kind.He, a changed man, put his rings in a box.She, the wife, did move? From the guarded garden?Did she loose a home court advantage when she moved out
of the hood?, (If that is even the case)?Out from the land protected by the converging
trees.Nice appearance by Ben Kingsley and generally great stroke of comic relief characters,
In the casting.It's really great to see an outfit like Marvel really give important roles to people of color to Asian folks

myralynortiz," Packed with action, humor, and a beautiful story","I really loved this movie. I'll admit, there's a lot left to be explained (where the rings came from, who the mom is, etc), but the director and producers definitely got the chemistry, humor, and acting right.The movie is just so jam packed with action. Even with a complex story line, it had a lot of action (usually complex story lines have a lot of lead in and are slow to warm up, but this definitely was not the case). And after watching Michelle Yeong be Miss Mean Mom-in-law in Crazy Rich Asians, it was so beautiful and wonderful to see her as nurturing auntie and just a complete bad-ass with her martial arts (I missed her days of Crouching Tiger, I'll admit).Simu Liu was beyond amazing. His chemistry, humor, and not to mention the way he kicked ass on screen, was so damn entertaining. And finally, a movie where AAPI are the heroes. What else could I ask for? The cherry on top was Awkwafina's blunt ass humor and the way she broke uncomfortable silences with her awkwardness. Gotta love it.I'd definitely see this movie again. One of the best Marvel movies I've seen thus far. I can't wait to see where the story line goes, what's up with the sister, and I mean...with Wong being there, Dr. Strange's future appearance is inevitable. I can't wait!!!

Benslie, Overcomes stereotypical Marvel movie elements to feel refreshing,"One of the real standouts for me in the movie was the fights scenes. The MCU is not really known for having interesting fight scenes and really most of them are just bland and cliché but Shang-Chi brought something new and I loved it. Every single fight scene was so well done and paced super well and Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed this, did an amazing job directing the fight scenes in this movie. The fight scenes in this movie were probably the best part especially since you can tell that all of the actors in this movie, especially Simu Liu, did most of the stunt work themselves. It's also insane to think that other than this movie Simu Liu has only really acted in one other thing but you could barely tell. He played Shang-Chi so well and brought so much emotion that everybody can easily relate to and love him. Honestly, everybody did an amazing job acting in this movie and I have to say I was skeptical with Awkwafina, who plays Katy, but she proved me wrong. But for me, the real scene-stealer was Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, who plays Xu Wenwu, as the villain. The villains in Marvel movies are mediocre at best but he decided to change that with this movie. Xu Wenwu was such an intriguing villain that the audience can easily sympathize with and relate to him. The cinematography in this movie is gorgeous to look at and you can see the detail that was put into it. Depending on where the movie is at the lighting reflects that area. I will say though is that this movie has a bit of slower pacing that at times does work in its favour but in other parts, I very much was wanting the movie to hurry up. In the end, Shang-Chi is such a heartfelt Marvel movie that does have some issues but is still enjoyable.",5 September 2021

The action was awesome the visuals both practical and CG were awesome and the story wasn't over complicated or too simple. Saw it with friends and we enjoyed it start to finish. Simu Liu and Awkwafina have great chemistry and Tony Leung Chiu-wai is very relatable and relatable as a villain and person. Over all I love the movie the most for feeling both down to earth and human while also being full Marvel wonder. Like Iron Man, the way it opens a wide and beautiful future for Marvel leaves me optimistic and excited.",3 September 2021
AnimatedCritic, A Grand Adventure,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a great Marvel Studios film. The story was fun and engaging, and was surprisingly emotional, with Shang Chi's relationship with his father and sister. The father's death was surprisingly impactful, and which the movie did well. One issue with the story was that the film would take a pause with the plot for flashbacks and exposition. They do make the film boring and slow at times, but there's not many. Plus, the flashbacks can be helpful
The visuals and action scenes in this film are, in my opinion, some of the best action scenes in the MCU. The film takes advantage of the martial arts action to deliver epic fight scenes. The visuals were also stellar. The CGI was top notch, and the backgrounds were some of the best from Marvel.The Characters were all fun to watch, and throughout the movie, you feel engaged in these characters. Shang Chi and Katy's chemistry is great. The villain was a great antagonist in this film. Some characters were bland and forgettable, but the good ones shine the most throughout the film.Overall, it's a great MCU film with a compelling story, great fights and visuals, and engaging characters. IT can be a bit slow at times, but the film is a must watch. MY favorite MCU film since Far From Home.",5 September 2021
koltonbrett, Thrilling & Funny,"This movie gave me hope that there are still bright days ahead for the MCU. Shang-Chi is very different from what we've seen in the past but it's so good. It's visually stunning and the action sequences are thrilling. It had the quality of action that I was expecting from Black Panther. The ten rings are fascinating to watch in use. There were such epic moments that I had to rewind and watch again a few times. I really wish I could have seen this is IMAX. It's one of the few movies that would have been a truly special experience.With a story like this one, things could have very easily taken a downward turn into the realm of cheesiness and over the top. But it's all done so well. The comedy and serious moments are balanced really well. There are some real laugh out loud moments but the movie never feels silly. The back-flashes are interesting and meaningful.One of my favorite surprises of this movie, is that it redeems the worst villain twist of the MCU. You know Marvel and Disney have done well when we look forward to seeing these new characters in the future.",19 November 2021

SAMTHEBESTEST, Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) :
Brief Review -Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",5 September 2021
anastasiadonos, What a beautiful movie!,"Laugh, fights, drama, comedy, beautiful landscapes, dragons, martial arts , it's all wrapped up nice and smoothly!I had an amazing time watching it!Also the music was great!Worth watching it!",12 October 2021
Mysterygeneration, Marvel movies are like watching a family drama film from a Chinese series.,"A younger Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is compelled to go back to his father's risky organization, The Ten Rings. He groups up together along with his excellent pal Katy (Awkwafina) and his estranged sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) to forestall Wenwu for good.Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings mark MCU's first Asian-led superhero film. There had been Asian characters before, inclusive of Wong (Benedict Wong) from Doctor Strange and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) from Thor. But they have constantly been sidekicks, flunkeys, or comedian relief.Wenwu is a powerful crime lord who runs an evil empire constructed across the energy of ten historical earrings that he makes use of to generate blasts of energy.Shang-Chi is a heart-warming tale syringed with humor. Co-writer-director Destin Daniel Cretton knows his circle of relative dynamics and superbly units the tone. Despite the humanity on show, it is the revolutionary martial arts that are the USP. The movement would not depend closely on virtual trickery withinside the actual world.The chemistry among the actors is palpable, exuding an actual feel of a located own circle of relatives. The film's actual villain is grief, pushed via way of means of Wenwu at the cost of his children.Shang-Chi is a prevailing mixture of the Chinese way of life and a hit Marvel formula. Despite pacing issues, it supplies a highly unique step withinside the proper path for Asian representation. Simu Liu, Awkwafina, and Tony Leung deliver multi-faceted characters to life.",6 January 2022

snowadian, 9 Rings at Minimum!,"Great movie, and one of my favourite MCU movies (just behind Thor Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Volume one). Amazing cast, fresh story, and out of this world CGI! Highly suggest you see it in a theatre, for the full experience!The loss of the one star is because as an Asian martial arts movie, it doesn't entirely live up to the greats that have come before it (Crouching Tiger, Hero, etc). Saying it is close though, is praise enough!Very excited this group is part of the MCU, excited to see more!",20 September 2021
bthomasmarggraf, Good - but still underwhelming.,"The first third was really enjoyable, excellent pacing, well timed jokes and incredible hand-to-hand-combat scenes. I already thought about seeing it a second time but the rest of the movie had a completely different feel to it. The second part for me was a drastic change (basically after the group is captured). Awkwafina, who was good in the beginning began to annoy with too many jokes and goofy moments and she did feel quite out of place which continued for the rest of the movie. The OG Mandarin appearing was a nice callback but he as well felt way too goofy and is just a cheap comic relief without actual importance to the story. You could probably cut 30min or so of less imports scenes without hurting continuity of the film. The final part was surprisingly different than any other MCU final but still came of as underwhelming to me because I really didn't need another CGI monster fight (although Shang-Chi's dragon looked good) and all in all the whole ending was a bit too much of everything. First you got the village fighting the Ten Rings while Shaun begins to fight his dad (this fight goes on for quite a while and could have easily been the end fight) who later opens a gate which leads to more fighting between humans and monsters and monsters and other creatures - you get what I'm trying to say. At some point you just want closure and as I already said, this final part really drags.Sadly some parts of the movie looked way more immersive than others and what also took away some fun for me were the trailers that showed way too much of the movie which takes away a lot of excitement (e.g. Abomination scene). It almost reminded me of some old MCU trailers where they basically showed the whole movie.The music did remind me a bit of Black Panther since it's a mixture of classical/culturally inspired music and modern pop songs, I definitely enjoyed it.Overall Shang-Chi is still a good movie to watch because it has some talented new actors playing interesting new characters (I really liked Razorfist), a brilliant fight choreography and some cool set-pieces. Sadly it's clever and quick beginning forces the last hour +/- to feel kinda slow and unbalanced while the ending is a thing of personal preference. I still think you can enjoy the whole thing if you know what you're going into. The post-/end credit scenes are also great.",2 September 2021
joy-72262, I love Tony Leung's talent.,"CG in this movie looks so good. Their acting performances made me enjoy it. However, I want to watch this movie because Tony Leung. He is so talented and charming, I think the scenes in the end was too less for him, it's definitely better if the director have put more detail of emotional scenes.",13 November 2021
fissorevincent, Quite a surprise,"I came in the movie theatre just expecting a run of the mill cog in the MCU... and I came out seeing the best solo original movie since Guardians of the Galaxy back in 2014.It has a charming, kind of relatable antagonist. A relatively likable sidekick. A three dimensional antagonist. A far reaching redemption arc with Ben Kingsley. Good action pieces. Well placed emotional moments. The only thing it might lack would be some additional real world set pieces, but apart from that, I cannot find much fault with it.Hopefully, it gets a sequel and the character gets a stronger presence in the larger MCU. He frankly deserves it thanks to this movie.",1 September 2021

matthewgolbourn," The MCU, has a massive hit on its hand with Shang-Chi","""Simu Liu"" really brings everything to life and embodies Shang-Chi to complete perfection, almost as if he was born for this role, to a point where he will become marvel fans new favorite, and In my opinion, is on par with the casting likes of ""Roberts Downey Jr"" (bold statement I know), but along side ""Simu Liu"" actress ""Awkwafina"" will also steal the hearts of many fans, bringing many smiles and laughs to viewers faces and becoming something so much more then just a side character, fans will route to see her more and more in the future future.The actions scenes are nothing but bliss to see, perfectly choreographed fights that really capture the style and heart of martial arts. The special effects are beautiful to the eye and in the last two acts will simply blow you away and introduce you to a new world to see and new life to capture you and completely immerse you into the world of Shang-Chi.As for the story, Shang-Chi carries alot of weight and heart, that will provide many laughs with its humor but will also pluck the strings of every ones heart, with out saying to much, Shang-Chis story is something of a symphony with its story telling, what could of ended up being a basic story, end up being a deep, thrieving with life, story with plenty of meaning, with a broken family at its heart, each character has their story, taking their different paths back to be whole again. Some fans my leave with a tear or two.As a whole, Marvel manages to yet again, provide us an amazing cast to embody its iconoc comic characters and bring everything and every one to life on screen. Shang-chi, is a consistent adventure from start to finish and provides nothing but pure MCU entertainment at its finest, and will leave fans begging for more of Shang-Chi.",4 September 2021

leogeorgeburton, What a Comeback,"This is by far the best choreographed MCU film to this point but that by far doesn't mean that this is the best MCU film. Also WenWu is by far one of the best MCU Villains of all time because of how much character development he had throughout the film.The train sequence and the battle ring arena are by far some of the best fight scenes in the entire MCU alongside this Abomination's long awaited return in this film that really helped bring the battle ring arena sequence to life. Alongside this Razor Fist really makes every action scene he's in feel threatening due to his unique appearance and abilities.The only reason why this film only gets a 9/10 in this film is because of how ridiculous the final battle in this film was as it really didn't fit within the film and really felt a lot more like a final showdown in Godzilla Monster battle compared to an MCU film, if they had just used WenWu as the main antagonist for the final battle it would definitely have a 10/10 form me.",21 September 2021

mslangston, Marvel has stepped it up again!,"Very great choreography, every fight tells a great story and the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Only reason that this isn't 5 stars is that the final act did what Black Panther did, became too superheroy and got distracted by CGI battles rather than getting into a great family battle between father and son.

It definitely focuses on introducing new characters unlike what people think that these solo mcu movies are just there to set up for a must see event.I just don't understand why people are rating this one star when it hasn't even been released in the majority of countries. People just be hating for no reason.,1 September 2021
marauder-02891, The movie has story telling and action in a working balance.,"The people who give the movie a 1-4/10 reviews are having an agenda against this movie, and they are not honest or objective about it at all.The comic version of the mandarin is different, the power of the ten rings are different, does it make he movie bad? Not at all.The ""Marvel formula"" is present here, but it shows a different part of the MCU and it is just like the Black Panther, an important part of world building.The theme of the movie is about family, i expected it focused more on the action, but it had a unique balance between the story telling and the action scenes, you get them both at the same time and it makes sense.I write this review only because it is a very petty thing to downplay or misrepresent a movie just because of an agenda, and i see that a lot nowdays.The actors were good, the mandarin, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai was the main reason i watched this movie and he did not disappointed me.Should you watch this movie? I think you can enjoy this movie, it is not a ""masterpeice"" but it holds its own weight just fine.",4 September 2021
Filmdokter," A new direction, but it doesn't feel that way","Why continue? That was the main question I had after the great arc of the MCU phases 1-3. I know...financially it would be stupid to not go on but from a creative perspective...what can top those first three phases? Black Widow was okay as a stand-alone picture and the same can be said by Shang-Chi. It is not a bad film. It's entertaining enough, the character of Katy is fun and the action (a lot of waving around with the arms though) is sufficient. But despite its new characters and Asian / martial arts vibes it does feels like I have seen it all before. I know I am not the target group for these films so probably that's the reason I'm getting bored by most MCU films. So..if you are looking for 2 hours of fun but utterly forgettable entertainment...this is okay. But then again; there are countless other films out there that can provide the same.",23 January 2022

The movie is a good looking product and the action scenes are enjoyable to watch.However those qualities are present in most if not all Marvel movies, and this one has nothing else going for it. I watched it only 2 weeks ago and I barely remember the plot.Simu Liu did decent in the main role, a bit wooden but overall okay for an unknown actor. Awkwafina once again delivered Awkwafina. I have no idea how she keeps getting work. A proper actress would have done better, but I guess they wanted comedy relief.Anyway, it's good for a single viewing and I doubt you would ever want a second.",8 January 2022

sagor-9364, Visually Stunning!!,"Well definitely the best production by marvel following Endgame. An absolute treat to watch. The main attraction is obviously the amazing fight sequence that's up there with the best fight scenes of MCU, and also the background music is perfectly fitting to the tone and setting of the film. What many might think that the plotline does not have enough depth. But I'd beg to differ as the way they've changed the Shang Chi character, introducing his father as the wielder of the ten rings and changing the power of the rings altogether is an amazing approach itself. The merging of different components and changing the storyline from the comics has been common in the MCU but none of them is as unique as shang chi. I'd say if they brought the original shang chi from the comics, then it would've been a mediocre movie. But they made every character unique, even the villain has a backstory to which everyone can relate. The fight sequences give goosebumps everytime I watch 'em. Can't wait for the sequel!!!",24 January 2022
Jonas1969, Better Chinese than American,"Shang-Chi has some gorgeous cinematography, good CGI, good acting and the best depictions of Chinese legends I have ever seen on screen but even so it isn't great.The problems here are with the writing. Shang-Chi and his best friend Katy aren't very likeable characters despite Simo Liu and Awkwafina's best effort to be charming. The main villain Xu Wenwu is supposedly monstrous yet somehow his story ark makes him less scary and mostly just pitiable. The other characters are mostly good but they are smaller roles.The only times I got excited were when we got to see classic Chinese legends brought to life and China is where the story should have stayed. The only reason we start in San Francisco is to justify speaking English. I did like that they mostly spoke Chinese when it was appropriate but they could just have set it in China and spoken English throughout.. or even better Chinese throughout.I wish I could be excited at this new character in the MCU, but it didn't start very promisingly.",23 November 2021

satisachin-47518, Not a good SUPERHERO movie!,All I can say about Shang Chi is that it is something fresh.The actions sequences are very well choreographed. The music is pretty good and the performance of the cast does not disappoint.Ben Kingsley as Trevor is a total waste of the actor's potential.Marvel once again does not give a proper arc to the villain and so I felt nothing for him (and even Shang Chi) when he dies at the end.The main problem with the movie is that it does not give a good motive for Shang Chi to become a superhero.The film (like most superhero movies nowadays) is focused more on the SUPER part of the character than the HERO).,29 January 2022
chawk-76623, Typical Martial Arts Superhero film,"Marvel played it safe with this one and made a standard film about a Chinese-American dude that knows kung-fu. Shang-Chi in this movie is nothing like in the original comics. Very americanized and people-pleasing take on the character. The movie has it's strong points like Tony Leung as the Mandarin. He feels like the only genuinely real character in the movie whom I can relate to. You can feel his every emotion and he is overall the best thing about this movie as so many have said. I actually enjoyed the original Shang-Chi comics because of their deep philosophies and introspective queries, plus the groundbreaking way they mixed action with interesting stories. This movie is lacking in that department. Generic martial arts action we have seen before, boring story for the most part, too many forced jokes and try hard laugh-inducing scenes, and westernization of Chinese culture. All-star Michelle Yeoh makes an appearance in the third act and does her famous tai-chi and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon schtick. Wong also appears and is fun as always. Abomination was in the film for just as long as he was in the trailer. Oh yeah, and Ben Kingsley reappears as Trevor Slattery, the fake Mandarin actor from Iron Man 3 and his story since then is addressed. That little creature he had was annoying rather than the typical cute character they intend to put onto all of these movies. Overall, I expected better, so now I may just wait until the new Spider-Man comes out to go back to the theaters. This was a filler movie that felt rushed.

IronMan, GOTG, Black Panther, Thor, and Spiderman Homecoming had better plots but Shang-Chi offered a ton of heart.The fight scenes were amazingly done and the climax of the film was actually visually beautiful.

SeriousJest, Great Example that Movies Don't Need to be Whitewashed to be Successful,"According to IMDB's trivia page for this film (my source for most factual assertions herein), Liu tweeted in December 2018 about asking Marvel for the role of Shang-Chi. He later retweeted that original tweet on July 20, 2019, thanking them. Cretton said that a lot of contenders were considered for the lead role, but the perfect package was in Liu. ""He has the athletic abilities, but he's also a terrific actor, showed fantastic chemistry with Awkwafina, is fluent in English and Mandarin and is comfortable shifting between Western and Eastern cultures."" I couldn't agree more. This movie really depended on all of those qualities, as well as his charisma and passion, and Liu has all of that and more. He has a bright future in Hollywood.Renowned Hong Kong film actor Leung was also a perfect choice to pair opposite Liu. While Leung was Cretton's first instinct when thinking about who to cast as Xu Wenwu, Cretton thought that there was ""no way we'll ever get him."" Fortunately, Leung was thrilled to join the film, as he is a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). When Marvel Studios contacted Leung, they gave him full authority to invent his own background for this iteration of his character. He sought to give the character more depth and credibility: ""I tried to explore the reasons that could have led him to become who he is. He's a man with history, who craves to be loved. He is a sociopath, a narcissist and a bigot, but he is also human and has a family."" Leung displayed strength, class, leadership, tenacity, an intimidating presence, intense inner turmoil, and a surprising emotional vulnerability beneath his cold exterior. Cretton stated that he and Leung had discussed whether Wenwu (named after the Chinese dual concept of wen (civil administration) and wu (martial administration)) had the ability to love, and ""Tony emphatically said yes."" Leung saw his character as a man who genuinely loves his family but doesn't know how to show it.This movie is visually beautiful, featuring captivating sets, rich colors, and stylish costumes. The final film features over 1,700 visual effects shots. The village in Ta Lo (which is actually a region with cities, despite the featured ""monkish"" village) was especially stunning, including the fantastic creatures roaming around.The action sequences are all elite. The bus fight, in particular, is epic.This movie is also important for cultural reasons. It is Marvel Studios' first superhero film with an Asian leading protagonist. The first English line isn't spoken until about 10 minutes into the movie, and there is a particularly inspiring conversation regarding the importance of given names in Chinese culture.Cretton, for whom Marvel films were never a goal until he heard that Shang-Chi was entering the MCU, was intent on accurately representing the richness of Asian culture. In an interview with CinemaBlend, Cretton stated that, for him, ""one of the biggest parts of this production was having all of these voices on set to say, 'That food is not what he would have on the table, that music is not correct. If Wenwu is really from this area, he wouldn't have that on the wall.'""
Shang-Chi's father in the comics was a character named Fu Manchu, ""an obviously problematic deeply stereotypical character,"" according to Cretton. So, the character was rebuilt from the ground up for this film.Xialing was originally going to have a red streak hair extension, but it was dropped a month into filming, at Meng'er Zhang's request, after she read a Teen Vogue article covering how frequently rebellious Asian women in popular media are given such an accessory.This movie is a great example that films don't need to be whitewashed to be successful. It made $94.4 million in the US box office, shattering the box office records for the 4-day Labor Day weekend by beating Halloween (2007)'s $30.5 million record.",3 April 2022

I just really love the character writing of everyone in this movie , you can easily understand each character because you get to see caused there motivation.

kevin_robbins, This movie is way better than it should be and is a worthwhile addition to the marvel universe,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched at the theatre. The storyline for this movie follows a young man and his best friend who work as parking attendants and are one day attacked by super villains. As they dig into the young man's past they discover his father is behind the attack with the purpose of hopefully brining his family back together. This movie is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (Just Mercy) and stars Simu Liu (Blood and Water), Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (Infernal Affairs), Ben Kingsley (Iron Man 3), Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians). The storyline for this movie is way better than it should be and has crazy depth around all of the characters. You really understand the what, when and why behind every circumstance and perspective. The acting is outstanding and the characters are perfectly portrayed. The special effects are awesome both in terms of the action scenes and backdrops. The dragons may have been a bit overdone; but other than that, A++++. The choreography was also excellent and seeing Yeoh in this really made me smile. This movie is way better than it should be and is a worthwhile addition to the marvel universe. I'd strongly recommend it. I'd score this a solid 8/10.",28 October 2021
jasondavies-82284, Brilliant,No one to really write reviews but after seeing this thought I would tell people how good this film is . I thought I would like it a mix of Martial arts and marvel but it far exceeded expectations . It's fun with a great story and fantastic action but the Comedy bits are hilarious a must see for any marvel fan 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻,4 September 2021
ethanbresnett, A wonderful addition to the MCU!,"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.Yet again Marvel Studios knocking it out of the park!",4 September 2021
maxwelloreocookie, This is everything Black Panther should've been.,"I know I'm late to the party, but pleasantly surprised how amazing this movie is.The main character was actually interesting in this movie, unlike Black Panther. I've never heard of Simu Liu before this movie, as I'm sure most people haven't either, but he did his thing. Then there's the 2nd main character, his best friend(and potential love interest?), Katie. I'd normally find a character like this annoying, but it worked, in my opinion at least. It may have worked for me because Shang-Chi and her had amazing chemistry, and it was a type of relationship I don't see portrayed often in movies at all, so that made it even better and more fresher for me.The action was top notch. It's the Marvel movie I seen with most actual fight chorography, and actually amazing chorography. I heard one of Jackie Chan's stunt team members was the main fight chorographer, and I could see that 100 percent. There is a lot of CGI as expected from an MCU movie, but it's not an overuse of CGI. I think whenever the CGI was used, it was necessary. With the mystic stuff in this movie, CGI is the only way, but the actual fighting and close-quarters combat was actually real, they didn't unnecessarily CGI that like they usually do in other moves *cough* Black Panther *cough* MCU Spider-Man.As for the main plot, it was a little typical MCU formulaic, but still done better than most Marvel movies I've seen. Overall, highly recommend. I don't meet a lot of people who seen this movie that think it sucks. It's that good!",13 November 2021
bostonct, Not entirely what you expected,"This movie has a lot of balance and solid chemistry. I thought there would be the excess kung-foolish and overacting but only a little. Excellent comedic time, decent storyline, several connections to other stories, and a sprinkle of Disney. They did copy a bit from Nobody, Speed and the Jaws character from James Bond but it was OK.You won't be disappointed.",4 September 2021
jenkinscammy, The worst offering in the MCU,"This movie makes Black Widow look like an Oscar winning screenplay.The story is just SOOOO bad. There's way too much raw exposition about past events. It feels like half the movie is spent recounting the past in stale narrative exposition. When this much backstory is needed, then you're trying to pack too much into a single film.Character motivations are unclear. Shang Chi's behavior is inexplicable at times, and his sidekick's behavior is similarly confusing. The movie opens with the two of them in low paying jobs, yet somehow they are jet-set world travelers at the drop of a hat. Shang continually puts his friend in life-threatening danger.The movie is weakened by fan service. The callback to Iron Man 3 makes zero sense. Casting Ben Kingsley for comedic relief does nothing for the story.This movie all but breaks the MCU's continuity and overarching story. It introduces new dimensions, races and powers without regard for existing storylines.Cameos don't help. Kingsley's Trevor Slattery feels about 10 years too late and most of his previous story arc from ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Hail to the King"" is negated and/or ignored. Wong is used as comic relief, but doesn't help much more than that.There's nothing fresh in this movie, just Disney trying to cash in on an inferior product.",4 September 2021

jace_the_film_guy, Mid-Tier MCU,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a mid-tier entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action choreography was gorgeous and the score set a powerful tone. Unfortunately, the protagonist lacked charm and his persona was split rather than conflicted. What he lacked in personality, Awkwafina more than made up for (sometimes to a a fault). The other characters were fine but forgettable, with the exception of Wenwu, who was the best part of the film.My main complaint with Shang-Chi is in the climactic third act. Introducing and destroying a villainous beast in the final 20 minutes is never a good idea. The dragon ""Dweller-in-Darkness"" felt unnecessary and distracted from the true conflict between father and son.This film is saved by the phenomenal action sequences, especially on the bus and outside the building in Macao. Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings left me excited for the next phase in the MCU from a production standpoint, but wary about the characters.",27 November 2021
iaminfinite-87116, As Close to Perfect as Possible,"This is the most visually stunning film in the Marvel universe. It features the most impressive physical fight scenes yet in the cannon.

I'm going to return to it time and time again, simply because of how enjoyable and entertaining it is. I cannot wait for the next Shang-chi film! Wow!! LOVE THIS STORY!! Fantastic! I hope they re-release this in theatres when the second film comes out because it would be phenomenal on the big screen.",13 November 2021
RY4N_HUGH3S, Best fight scenes since the raid!?,"I have loved marvel movies since the beginning and the continuous entertainment through the years is phenomenal. Marvel continues to deliver every time!I was hyped for Shang-Chi since the first trailer, the trailers I would agree don't serve the film true justice, this is because of how little they show you.The characters are thorough and loveable, the storytelling is delightful and don't even get me started on the action. The action goes against all the issues people say about modern day action films. I believe the fight scenes are up there with the raids. They are choreographed fantastically, they are fast paced and adrenaline pumping.The theme of the film is sensational and it truly delivers. My only issues with the film is I think the second act can be a bit slow compared to the first and third act. Even with that said there are twists and turns along the way to keep you surprised.At minimum I believe it is a guarantee you will enjoy this film, Shang-Chi is one of the best, if not the new best solo character marvel movie.All I can say is if you love fight movies, action movies, marvel movies or fantasy films. This is for you. Even if you aren't big on them this film will by minimum give you a good time. It's a blast, I'm planning to go see it again soon and I can't wait! I am beyond ecstatic for Shang-Chi to be apart of the Avengers!Go see it!",5 September 2021

moatandbailey, crime drama meets Alice in Wonderland...stunning,"If Mario Puzo or Truman Capote were to write a fantasy it would feel like this. Or if Lewis Carroll were to write a crime drama it would feel like this. ""Shang Chi"" is, in essence, this sort of fascinating, singularly unique and audacious combination wrapped up in a wildly entertaining martial arts film. ""Shang Chi"" feels like no other MCU production because of this interplay of seemingly dissimilar elements. But, where else could one possibly come across such an engrossing mix than in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where a raccoon once sent e-mails to a Russian assassin? That's the beauty of ""Shang Chi;"" it propels quite enthusiastically and energetically into this vast inexplicable new terrain which only Stan Lee and his fellow artists and creators could have envisioned or foretold. An extraordinary offering from Marvel Studios, ""Shang Chi"" is a must-see!",6 September 2021
jimgibson-21798, Excellent Action Fantasy Martial Arts Masterpiece,"I Saw this today at the BFI London IMAX with my 14 year old and his friend and we all enjoyed this immensely! Its thrilling & races along at a great pace from the first scene! It is the perfect mix of Action Fantasy & lighthearted comedy with a decent story line to bind it all together, one could say another typical Marvel movie churned out of their factory production line, however, I felt that this one really is miles better than so many of the recent ones due to the incredible martial arts fight scenes, they are so fast it's really exciting to watch. I also enjoyed the fact that I didn't recognise any of the main actors other than Ben Kingsley (who is hilarious) this often makes a movie much easier to get into than when it's the same old super star faces.

bob-the-movie-man, Ten Rings to rule them all...,"Positives:
This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.The relationship built between Shaun and Katy is wonderful, and the actors deliver on it brilliantly: no wonder when you have the exceptional Awkwafina on the other end of it. Similarly, the relationship built between Shang-Chi and his father is powerful, thanks to some wonderful acting from Tony Chiu-Wai Leung. So good in the gripping (and erotic) 'Lust, Caution', I believe this is his first English-speaking film.With the odd exception (see below), the special effects are top-notch.Negatives:
I thought this was 5* all the way until the final reel, when we descended into a CGI-driven ""Godzilla vs Kong"" finale. I hate CGI that's just a blur of action across the screen where you're struggling to understand what's going on. Less would be more here for me.The movie makes extensive use of 'flashbacks' and, for me, there was a bit too much heavy-handedness in their use. I muttered ""enough already"" to a few of them, since they were taking us out of the movie's current narrative.There were a couple of effects that looked like the intern at the special effects company had put them together during a coffee break. An early plunge of a jeep into a forest and some rather obvious green-screen stuff in the finale. Surprised that these weren't caught and redone.Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.(For the full graphical review and video check out #onemannsmovies on the web, Facebook and Tiktok.

masterdeo, Top tier,There has been some great additions to the MCU so far this year and phase 4 is definitely an experimental phase; Shang-Chi is no exception.Visuals are pretty great along with great characters and acting. Shang-Chi himself was overshadowed by Wenwu (The Mandarin) in the trailers which didn't give you a good idea about the character but he shines in the film.Wenwu also manages to be a great villain. With a sympathetic drive to his villainy he manages to avoid the 1 dimensional template past MCU villains unfortunately fall into. His death put his story full circle.The film also manages to do a lot of world building in its 2 hour and 12 minute runtime in an impressive and not rushed way.Trevor Slaterey was a character that split the fan base in the middle when Iron Man 3 debuted but when we know the real Mandarin exists his character can be less divisive. He still remains a hilarious character and they don't forget his position as a Liverpool fan. His Planet of the Apes monologue was somewhat emotional for a kind of dumb scene and was well acted.The action is brilliant especially for the bus fight. The final fight with the rings was a fun and unique fight however the great protector vs dweller in darkness was a good looking yet somewhat boring fight that felt as if it didn't fit in the film and the hand to hand fights were brilliant.Both credit scenes are brilliant and the mid credit scene is one of the best in the MCU with appropriate cameos that leave you excited for the future. It also connects the film to the wider MCU. The second scene was great and allows excitement for the sequel to rise.Overall the film is great and has some great character moments however the final fight ends in a chi mess that perhaps didn't belong in the film.,6 September 2021

theobonding, Creative and innovative ideas from Marvel!,"It's so amazing to see more Asian and female representation of films - this film is a representation of Marvel's ability to adapt, adapt to different cultures, languages, race. That they are able to create new story lines, but also branch them together. I have to say, amazing cast too! I can't wait to see what else Marvel has to bring out, I hope other studios take inspiration and follow suit. People enjoy different yet relatable, and this film didn't disappoint!",3 September 2021
dan-ilya, Movie made for martial arts fans and Chinese,"To clear out the reviews fight. I believe that the situation is like this:If you love martial arts you will love this film. If you are Chinese you will probably like it, and even more if you live outside China.If you are a huge Marvell fan you will like this movie or at least tolerate it.All the rest will probably be disappointed.It is still a Marvell film, and the quality is good. The story is less good, and at many points loses any common sense even for a ""superheroes"" movies that initially lack any sense. Marvell could do better at least with the story.",16 September 2021
patrickharding-63013, Ugg,First hour was passable. Some good humour. Some good action sequences. Second hour was interminable. Tons of confusing cheap An overblown predictable climax. The lead actor was bland and utterly forgettable. His sidekick and sister were much more interesting. Terrible Disney bloodless crap overall.,22 November 2021
AdrenalinDragon, Welcome back Marvel!,"After a disappointing Marvel entry with Black Widow, Shang-Chi is the return to form movie Marvel needed to bounce back off on. With solid performances, great setpieces, fun action sequences, and some emotional depth and humour to it, it's the type of film you need to see on the big screen and just go along with the journey and fantastical elements. It's also paced well and intriguing for the runtime it has.The direction is solid and the characters get a good amount of screen time each to develop and have well placed flashback sequences. The martial arts fights are pretty well done and the CGI creatures look interesting with their designs and have good special effects. Overall, it's very well done and I didn't think Marvel could keep going, but they proved they can still make great stuff when they care about it.8/10.",4 September 2021
cyberknight, The Legend of the Ten Excuses,"Shang-Chi (why the hyphen and how is it supposed to be pronounced?), the son of the most powerful man on Earth (who no one had ever heard about,) makes ends meet in USA as a valet driver named ""Shaun.""After a gratuitous and unnecessary ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986) stunt with his girl friend (with a space in-between, or, perhaps, a hyphen), we discover Shaun's secret identity, as some assassins try to kill him in a bus ride to steal a pendant he's been wearing since his mother gave it to him when he was a child.Next, Shang-Chi goes to his sister's hideout, who has a similar pendant, using the address on a postcard he received. He hadn't heard of her since he ran away from his father's house, many years ago.At the hideout, Shang-Chi engages in a fight, just for exposition, against his sister, who defeats him in a matter of seconds. After that, cliché surprise, he finds out that she didn't send him the McGuffin postcard...! A moment later, the villains come crashing in, and eventually capture everybody, except for Shang-Chi, who is defeated by his father in a single strike, after he arrived at the hideout a few minutes later, time enough for a lot more expository fighting.With the family forcibly reunited, back at Shang-Chi's father's house, we discover that he has been hearing his deceased wife calling from ""beyond,"" that ""beyond"" being in the secret village she came from, which can only be reached through magical means.Eventually, Shang-Chi and friends manage to escape and head to the secret village, with the help of Ben Kingsley and a plushy merchandise. There, they train for one day, which was enough for them to master archery, wire-fu, dragon riding and Kamesen'nin-sama's iconic Kamehameha (TM) to defeat the father and the evil creature ""beyond"" a sealed gate, which has been luring the father into breaking the seal.Happy ending comes with a high price tag. Except for Aunt Michelle Yeoh, all other support characters die, including Shang-Chi's father, after a cliché redemption. Using the inherited Ten Rings, Shang-Chi kills the evil creature, very easily, actually.An awful lot of things in this film are incoherent, unnecessary or just plain dumb.1) The bus fight: why were Shang-Chi's henchmen trying to kill him, if his father wanted him alive (unless he didn't, but, in that case, they could have killed him in his apartment, while sleeping, not in a stupid bus)?2) Why Shang-Chi's father sent him a postcard with his sister's address? He already knew where both of them were, so why kidnap them together, when picking them one at a time would've been much cheaper, faster and easier?3) Why does Shang-Chi's father send minions to do things he is obviously able to do with a single strike of the Ten Rings? Actually, he usually shows up a little later just to do exactly that.4) Why cars, or helicopters? The controller of the Ten Rings can FLY, duh!5) Shang-Chi's girl friend masters archery in a single day, hitting moving target at impossible distances better than warriors that have been training for thousand of years.6) Shang-Chi's father couldn't defeat the great evil creature, even after thousands of years of wearing ad mastering the Ten Rings, but Shang-Chi, without any previous training with them, is able to kill the creature in a single battle (using a single move, actually, digging a whole in its chest with the Rings.)7) Why did they seal the destroyer-of-worlds creature, if all they needed to do was use the Ten Rings to kill it? Shang-Chi's father didn't create them, he just acquired them from some undisclosed place and learned how to use them. The first encounter with his soon-to-be wife showed that she not only knew the artefacts, but knew how to control them, so why not simply use them and end the menace?8) Why Shang-Chi and not his sister? Seriously, she's way better than him in the art of a-kicking, having been training non-stop for years, while he slacked in karaoke bars. She's the one most likely to have mastered the Ten Rings and the Kamehameha (TM) (in a single day or otherwise.) She also should've been the one to kill the evil creature.9) What was the deal with Ben Kingsley? I mean, I liked seeing him in the film (as in any film, really,) but I couldn't understand what he was doing there. Wasn't Shang-Chi's girl*friend the comic relief? The only thing he does is interface the communication between humans and the plushy merchandise. Any other McGuffin would have done there, or just remove it altogether, as the labyrinth itself is meaningless, as it doesn't lead to the village, but to a teleportation gate made of water (don't ask, just accept...)10) Shang-Chi doing the Kamehameha (TM) without saying ""kame... hame... ha!"" was very underwhelming... He could have said ""Turtle's Destroyer Wave Strike"" in Chinese, if using Japanese in a Chinese-centric film was a problem...Yeah, that last one was not really a thing, but it would've been a lot funnier. Shang-Chi's girl*friend actually mentions him doing the Kamehameha, for effect, so why not simply play along, or is only Deadpool allowed to break the fourth wall indiscriminately?Summarising, there was an evil creature that could have been killed using a special weapon, the Ten Rings, but, instead, was sealed behind a gate, just to release itself thousands of years later and, then, finally be properly killed by the mentioned weapon.The film is a series of excuses to tie several action-packed scenes together, without a coherent story to back them up. The titular Ten Rings are never explained, they are a McGuffin themselves, simply appearing on the first scene to introduce Shang-Chi's father and put the film into motion.The action scenes themselves are tainted with too much unnecessary wire-fu, making them cartoonish and disappointing.It's a big waste of Ben Kingsley's dramatic/comedic energy and Michelle Yeoh's martial talents.To put it in a relatable perspective, ""Shang-Chi"" was like the second half of ""Iron Man"" (2008), when all that we really wanted was that it was like the first half of it.",28 November 2021
rchosen-193-5535, Kind of confusing in terms of MCU.,"I loved the idea of Shangi Chi because it would bring Chinese culture into the MCU. Which I assumed meant they would explain how the myths were ""real world"" events. But instead you are left with more questions then answers.For example with Thor we learn that the ""gods"" powers are more or less what we on earth call science. But in this you see many normal Chinese mythological stuff without explanation of how it works.Or more to the point....
(spoilers)
Ok so some can control the wind it would seem. But how? Is it just an magical power? Where did it come from? How do you operate it?And the realm with the literal Chinese mythological creatures.... was it a realm on another planet? Which one? I can accept the rings working because they are some sort of magic device. But thats about it. You are just thrown into a ride with no idea whats going on.This all said, the movie felt out of place.",14 November 2021

The acting was great and had some heart (better in my opinion than Black widow) especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, and Michelle Yoeh. The soundtrack was very good. The film has some morals (something that I like to have in movies) like family and history protection, and the Asian issues in America. At the end, it's a very good movie to see in theaters with family. I give the movie 10/10.",11 September 2021

Web_Of_Doom," Ten rings but only 7 out of 10, but it will return!","The good news is Shang-Chi still has lots of potential to be a great super hero movie, as if you accept this movie as his origin story ( which it is ) then it is a reasonable introduction into the Marvel universe however when you compare this movie to the first movies starring Captain America, Captain Marvel, Iron Man, Thor, Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr Strange etc etc it is not as good an introduction but luckily those previous movies built a very strong foundation.Of course compared to the recent Black Widow ( 7 out of 10 ) & the Eternals ( 5 out of 10 ) this is a bit of a concerning drop in quality of the marvel universe, however with more established Marvel universe films coming out like the new Dr Strange, Thor, Black Panther, The Marvels ( Feb 17 2023 ), Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant Man, Captain America & eventually another Shang-Chi etc after those the future looks good so let's hope the quality rises up again.So yes the script could have been a bit better ( though the overall theme did just about come together ) & the over emphasis on comedy at the wrong times does miss the mark ( at the right times it hits the mark too to be fair ).So the decent script loses it a star ( as we expect it to be better ), then the movie does not have that much interest in it to make it re-watchable ( as won't be adding it to my Blu-ray collection ) like other marvel movies do such as Guardians of the Galaxy ( which is the perfect example of using humour at the right times in the movie, but staying serious when the scene requires it too ).So the fact it is worth watching once because we want to see the super hero in future Marvel movies is good, but it loses a star because I can't see why I would ever watch this movie again as it just does not capture it's audience.Finally the last star it loses making it still a decent 7 out of 10 movie so worth a watch, is there are too many convenient moments in the movie that make it bland & are designed to accentuate the supporting cast but not in a way that would be original, exciting or thought provoking ( which they deserved to have as the supporting cast were actually all good ) as the scenes the supporting cast get ( such as the awesome actor who is able to show that talent in other movies = Ben Kingsley ) are just not well written or directed well to make them stand out as really good as instead these filler moments do not add to the film like they should have done ( other Marvel movies are much more clever with these scenes ) so this important scenes have underwhelmed & lose a star.However I want to finish on a positive note, as this is still a good introduction to Shang-Chi & if this character is able to be integrated correctly into the Marvel universe with the likes of ( new Thor ), ( new Captain America ), Captain Marvel, Incredible Hulk & Dr Strange etc etc then we really could have something special again to watch & enjoy as the potential is there!",12 February 2022
Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187, Marvel's answer to Shonen Jump.,"Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots. And now, late 2021 we can finally go back to the movies en masse, though the road to recovery's far from over.Shang Chi is part-origin-story for a character we've never known before, part-CG-spectacle interlaced with nice kung-fu choreography in between, all in-universe expansion for Marvel's cinematic ambitions. And it makes you wonder how deeply they thought about paying reverence to everything from Bruce Lee to the Matrix, to Dragon Ball, The Last Airbender and Kung Fu Panda.Marvel is doing its best to escape the confines of Iron Man's legacy, and this seems like an earnest start for something far-removed from the likes of Spider-Man, and so on. Also makes you wonder if Awkwafina is gonna become a major player outside the Shang Chi movies alone.Shang Chi is the stuff you've come to expect from Marvel Studios; it's going big and it won't stop with every subsequent film here onward. Though bigger and better seems better fitted for high-concept space operas like Infinity War and Endgame than more earthbound character-driven stories.Shang Chi's good fun, and it really succeeds in being that during its runtime.",25 October 2021

b_trought, My girlfriend loved it. I was a little underwhelmed,"To start, Shang Chi is a film worth going to see. If you're a Marvel fan it'll be a film that you'll enjoy; story, links to the wider MCU, action, comedy, and visuals. Just take a look at the reviews on here and you get the idea that it's a v good MCU film, that is slightly different from others that we've seen.I thought to add a few things not mentioned in the reviews on here that struck me while I was watching;
a. The slow motion and music/sound during the slow Mo. Something I've noticed about Chinese cinema over the past 2 decades is the over use of slow Mo to try and be poignant or emotional. It's been overdone, especially with the slightly cheesey background music to labour the point. ShangChi leans heavily on these several times and I found myself rolling my eyes more than once. Admittedly you may not notice it.B. The CGI. I thought it wasn't great, particularly at the start in the forest fight and the bus scene. It got better though, and overall the climactic fight was well rendered, if a little disorientating.C. The 'eastern' mystical stuff. They tried to shoehorn in a couple of things but honestly it's kinda like an impression that a westerner would have about 'Eastern history and culture'. It reminded me a little bit of what Marvel did with The Ancient One (a Caucasian lady in Asian clothes), and the way Danny Rand tried to spout a few mystical phrases in Iron Fist.D. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Yuen Wah. Three major players in Chinese cinema going all the way back to the 80s (I think)... It was great to see them here, particularly Tony Leung who has some of the most expressive eyes in film (I know it's a weird thing to say, but he has) and Yuen Wah who was a classmate of Jackie Chan. I would have liked to have seen more of the latter to be honest and would recommend you check him, Jackie, Sammo Hung and Yuan Biao out on YouTube.E. The fight scenes. Overall they were very good, particularly the hand to hand on the bus (before the CGI). That one was sharp, aggressive and brilliantly choreographed. The one in the forest though!!! It's was one of that have been overdone in Chinese cinema, so an eye roller for me... ie a relationship developing as a result of a fight.F. The humour was great imo and the delivery was great overall.Like I said above it's worth seeing and you'll probably enjoy it. My girlfriend (who's not watch a whole lot of Asian cinema) did. I've seen a fair share of it, from the Shaw Brothers films up to modern day, so somethings did grate on me. Did I enjoy it though? Overall, yes.",3 September 2021
ericcollins-52811, Average,"I really liked the actors they casted for this movie but I felt they did not focus enough on developing the characters rather than just throwing a bunch of CGI at you. The CGI was some of the best I've seen don't get me wrong, but it heavily shadowed the most important part of any movie: the plot. More time needed to be put into that aspect and the amazing Marvel CGI will follow. Seems to be a trend with some Marvel movies, just making it really boring when you go deeper than surface level.",4 September 2021

jackgdemoss, Beautiful but boring,"Let me preface this by saying that my enjoyment of the movie may have been dampered by a poor night's sleep. That being said, the middle 45 minutes of this film had me nearly falling asleep, literally. The character development just couldn't hook me at all because it felt like they kept revisiting the same points.On a positive note, the visuals and martial arts are absolutely spectacular. The first act of the film contains most of the martial arts and it is so crisp and well-choreographed. The final act flexes all of the CGI dollas and they make they already big budget stretch far, with some of the more impressive sights you will see in a Marvel movie so far. This movie didn't quite hit the 8/10 for me to recommend people see it in theatres, but lets tack that up to me being tired and you go see it anyway!",7 September 2021
lareval, Really good blend of martial arts and MCU formula,"The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU. Just for that scene alone, this movie deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible. Shang Chi benefited from being a very unknown character and the movie gives him the opportunity to shine bright with his development. The story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical Marvel esque, it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema. A really great MCU movie, a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the Phase 4. Do not miss the two post credits scenes. The middle scene is exciting and the very last one is pretty intriguing. Bring it on, Marvel!",5 September 2021

Purely a fairy tale.The humor is good overall, apart from a couple of Katie's little jokes.And Shang-Chi himself turned out to be a little faded, lost against the background of everything that was happening.

It's outraging. Although the plot was a mess and this movie was all over the place - this was the true message that came across. The mother and the sister were the strongest characters, yet the mother had to give up her powers when she married this horrible man and the daughter - despite being overlooked all her life mustered up the strength and motivation to become a great fighter. Although she was way stronger than her brother, she ended up with nothing, while her brother is now the master of the rings.

arrowappledesign, Was this Mulan or a Marvel flick?,"It's an entertaining yet slightly boring film about family... I went in thinking it would be about learning about the Dark Magic of the MCU and the keepers of the magic. Instead of giving any answers to the magic side of the MCU, new plots and characters are introduced.Generic tropes in full force: bad guy knife hand served no purpose other than to further the plot. If he had a name, it didn't matter. He's in the movie a lot and supposedly commands something but it's never explained or the audience isn't supposed to care, which baffles me about the amount of screen time that character was given. A few characters were washed and repeated. The guy on the bus live streaming and narrating has been in a lot of marvel movies. He was Peter Parker's friend in Spider-Man. Except that movie was actually funny.All the funny parts were forced and fell flat for me. I didn't chuckle once. Quirky dialogue can be hit or miss and I felt like this movie was outdated when it came to dialogue; when the producers probably spent the most time re writing that side of the script. It didn't work.But I just say Shang was phenominal. I would love to see him come back. Awkwafina ... felt miscast. I think she did what she could with the role, but I also felt it was meant for a bubbly character and she played it like a guy's girl aka ""one of the guys"". It took me a while to realize awkwafina was not the sister.A lot of unanswered questions like why were the jade pendants so important if they didn't do anything once stolen/recovered? Why didn't the siblings want their lifelong heirlooms from a dead parent back once United with their father? Also the action sets were super confusing. Scaffolding on a building over 50 floors high, or more? A secret map that both pursing parties find quite easily? That throwaway thespian and his winged squishy contributed what to the story?This did not feel like a Marvel movie, and that's fine. But it hardly had any emotional investment for all those long-standing slow motion shots.A forgettable origin story with bland characters and no discernible antagonist.",8 September 2021

Jeremy_Urquhart," More movies like this, please, Marvel","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.",28 September 2021

e-79838, Too much of everything,"This movie doesn't really know what it is supposed to be. A Drama? A Fantasy flick? A Superhero Movie? A Bromance? A Comedy? It tries way too hard to appeal to every possible viewer. That is why it achieves nothing. It started well with some really awesome martial arts scenes, but then the story got more and more confusing. There were more holes in the plot than in Swiss cheese. For instance, a 14-year old trained assassin apparently got bullied at school - really?? And WHY was this guy who played a British actor even in the plot? The moment he showed up was the moment I was done with that movie. And then there were the over-the-top magical creatures who probably were supposed to get some ""awwws"" from the female audience. But the most disappointing thing to me was, that the more interesting and more badass sister got treated the way women typically get treated in Hollywood: she got totally ignored. Why did the male hero get all the rings? She did deserve at least half of them. It's male storytelling at its finest. As usual.",28 September 2021
deancremers, Shang chi and the beginning of a new era,"Let me start by saying damnnn, Marvel made an absoluut banger of a movie. It has one of the most developed antagonist in a marvel film and the CGI is just stunning to watch, let alone a very good story and all the great fight scenes.From beginning to end I had one big smile. If this is the first film of phase 4 then I can only expect bigger things to happen.Of course if you are a marvel fan go watch it!! But also if you are not this is in my opinion the best marvel film made and definitely worth your money.Phase 4 is destined for greatness.",1 September 2021

Vartiainen, Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.",8 November 2021
sweeney-94537, Underwhelming,"I went into this movie with a real open mind and I have to say that I was kind of disappointed, for me, the acting felt below par and the story felt very slow moving and didn't really go anywhere. I LOVED the fight scenes though, it was really cool to see pure hand to hand combat and martial arts be the centre of a MCU film. Overall I was not very pleased walking out of the cinema, I didn't feel attached to much of the characters either and there was no pace to the movie.",11 September 2021

pcoopershaw, Appealing in visuals and characters,"Let me start off by saying that this film is a nice blend of spider-man, and ant-man, when you look at the personality and humor of the characters. But in a way, this is honestly every marvel movie in one. The visuals are reminiscent of dr strange, the humor is quite like ragnarok, and the characters and backstory is just fantastic. A great movie to watch with your family, but it's also great for marvel fans. Maybe one of the best marvel superhero origin stories. The pacing is decent, and the visuals are phenomenal. And you'll be happy with all the little easter eggs and extras. This is a very fun movie, it's not too dark, and i can recommend this for every marvel fan out there, it's definitely worth the watch.

rossjackson2, Best Marvel movie in a while,This is definitely the best Marvel movie I've seen in a while and probably the most un-Marvel feeling one too. The fight seems are incredible - the bus fight being the stand out. Fantastic choreography and heavily influenced by old martial arts movies. The CGI throughout is amazing too as you'd expect from Marvel. I felt the amount of comedy was just right with Ben Kingsley smashing it again as Trevor - superb. As others have commented there are some pacing issues in the second half but overall it's a fun ride so enjoy! The first end credits scene is worth holding on for but don't bother with the second!,9 September 2021

bankofmarquis, See Shang-Chi on the Big Screen,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.Letter Grade A- (the finale needed to be better)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",12 September 2021
andrewthiel, Unique Marvel film is a blast!,"Having worked on this film's visual effects, I can safely say that I was pleasantly surprised when watching Shang-Chi at the premiere. Up to that point, I had not actually watched the full film.This movie is bolstered by a fantastic performance from Simu Liu, who I hope will star in many other great films. His charisma alone is a good reason to like the movie. The supporting performances weren't quite as memorable, but of course, they were not bad at all. As usual, the visual effects for this film were great (and I might be a tad too self-indulgent here), as was the direction by Destin Daniel Cretton.I am very excited to see where Shang-Chi will show up next!",3 September 2021
LilbigMedium14, Overrated,Was excepting something new from Marvel this time around but Shang-Chi still feels like its brought down by the Marvel formula. The action scenes are definitly a strong highlight along with the acting. I like a lot of the camera moves and the dynamic colours and costume design make this movie stand out among the other mcu films. Technically this is a massive achivment but sadly the story does not hold up. As the movie goes on the story gets weaker and weaker until it becomes a giant cgi fest like every other superhero movie ever. There is obviously a lot of heart and talent that went into this project but the mcu is turning 13 years old now and we are still using this same repetitive formula.Shout out to the guy that looked like Morgan Freeman he was the real star of the show.,25 September 2021

onsaltcoatsbeach, I was very embarrassed to watch this film as Asian,"I understand how diversity is important and it seems like one of such thoughts in this film.But no, I felt so strange to watch this film the last night, somehow I was ashamed and embarrassed with the story and all about this film.Respect the diversity, understand how Chinese market is important for Hollywood today, but please keep some balances and make more natural films.",11 September 2021
afwhitepigeon, In a word: Stunning.,"Shang-Chi will likely be heralded as the ""Chinese Black Panther,"" but in truth, this is the film Black Panther wants to be when it grows up. Easily top-5 in the MCU, and probably competes with Guardians of the Galaxy for my favorite of the bunch.There are several nods to the wider universe, and if you're a die-hard fan, they'll be quite rewarding, but they never distract from this mostly self-contained story.This movie is at times seriously, laugh-out-loud funny, but it never falls into the trap of allowing humor to undermine its emotional moments. Ben Kingsley and Awkwafina give particularly standout performances. And if the latter's, shall we say, overt comedic style can get grating for you, know that not only does she deliver it in small doses, but she also has some surprisingly heartfelt moments, too.Perhaps the most spectacular feature of this movie is its stuntwork. There are multiple incredibly long, exceedingly well-choreogrphed fight scenes. There are some which are the most creative, crazy, acrobatic fights since Jackie Chan's glory days in Hong Kong Cinema. Others take clear inspiration from the dance-like wirework of Wuxia films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, even borrowing one of its lead actors for one of them. Throughout, the camerawork is clear, without the rapid-fire cutting that pervades much of Hollywood. The cinematography at times takes wide angles to really showcase, rather than mask, its stunt performers. At other times, the cameraman is treated as another performer, right in the heart of the acrobatic choreography.While the the practical stunts will get lots of attention, the visual effects are just as beautiful, taking full advantage of the blockbuster budget. There are elemental effects that prove that a live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender movie could work. There are creatures that range from cute, cuddly animals to monsters that would make Kaiju films jealous. This movie even pulls off the difficult trick of making energy-based sci-fi weapons seem raw and visceral.In the center of all this spectacle is a surprisingly resonant personal story about a broken family. Tony Leung gives an incredible performance, making a millenia-old, super-powered warlord not just sympathetic, but even relatable. The titular character embodies one of the film's central themes of bringing together aspects of disparate influences to forge a unique identity. The other lead has a similar story, but hers is arguably even more compelling.All in all, Shang-Chi is a film that does just about everything right, and it does so while bringing its own fresh take, not just to the MCU, but to Hollywood filmmaking in general. They really knocked it out of the park with this one.",8 September 2021
iamdennisjoseph, Shang Chi The Best Marvel Movie or MCU's Phase 4,"A solid origin story for MCU's newest Avenger.If I were to summarize how this movie made me feel, I would say it was like a crossover of Raya and the Last Dragon, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and a mega blockbuster Jackie Chan film but with the never-tiring humor of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the first time in forever, I didn't need English subtitles for English conversations in an MCU film. Thank God for Asian-Americans haha.I want to leave out Simu Liu and Shang-Chi himself in this review because I think this movie is more about Tony Leung's character, the Mandarin, than it is about Shang-chi. This movie's central themes are grief, loss, moving on and finding passion in life. All these are heavier and deeper with The Mandarin than with Shang-chi. This film is like a beloved ancient Asian tale brought to life, crafted with respect and participated by the probably the best people for their roles.So many familiar faces appear in this movie, and it is always nice to remember which films in the franchise you saw some characters in and how they are all connected with each other.I am so excited for what Shang-chi can offer from here on out to the rest of the MCU. Asians really are winning with this representation in the Avengers. This movie is a homage to many superhero fans who are Asian. Asian kids finally have superheroes in the MCU they can see themselves in.",19 September 2021

ayojerkinskarega, Good Movie,"Production: Good script even though certain scenes were predictable. Solid editing, but yet again too much slow motion to try to make action scenes look good. Decent CGI, it can be a little too much at times. Good set pieces and wardrobe. 7/10.On screen: Simu Liu (Shang-Chi) and Awkwafina (Katy) acting was great. They have good chemistry throughout the movie which made their characters believable. Decent acting from the rest of the cast, some of it was cookie-cutter. Solid Cinematography overall. 7/10.Content/Impact: It's great to see Asian leads in American cinema that's not stereotypical, especially at a time when we see anti-Asian hate during COVID. Also, the range of imagery of powerful Asian women is great to see because it combats the ""docile"" Asian women motif. Also, the fact that the Asian woman wasn't sexualized helps combat those stereotypes. Lastly, the infusion of Asian culture in popular films is not only good for getting more diverse filmmaking on and behind the camera, it's also a step in having more diverse visibility which leads to more acceptance of each other. 10/10.Overall: Good introduction to new characters Shang-Chi and Ruiwen's place in the new phase of the MCU. 8/10.",3 October 2021

This movie wasn't bad at all...-the action fight scene was a mixture of classical chinese martial arts choreography as flying & floating around as some 1970s classic chinese kung fu movies like hidden dragon, crounching tiger & jet li's once upon a time in china with also realistic fighting style as well as jackie chan fighting style with a mixture of fantasy magic power of fighting style like ""dragon ball-Z"" lol.-the romance scene was soo beautiful with both shang-chi mother & father a better romance movie than other marvel superhero movie lol.-the landscapes & background graphics were so amazing well done! It is soo enjoying to see a beautiful landscapes of grass, trees, & with chinese mythology creatures.-the funny scene was really enjoyable to watch with mostly KATY !! Shang-chi close friend lol.-the storyline was 4 main character was SHANG-CHI, XIALING, WENWU, & JIANG LI. It was a very well done well written story line plot of these 4 main characters by showing flashbacks to the past of what had happened to these 4 characters.-the script was well done some had some serious scripts as WENWU,XIALING & SHANG-CHI but only 2 has the funny scripts as KATY & TREVOR SLATTERY! Lmao.-2 villains that work for WENWU was very well done made with their own job to do which was Razor-fist & Death dealer...-the most sad drama part was shang-chi father being stuck in the past with his wife that died long ago. Its was heart felt as heart broken... :-(the 2 BIG REASON why i gave this movie a (9 out of 10!) It is because 1! I wish the movie shows how shang-chi father WENWU! How he FOUND THE 10 RINGS of power as in the marvels comic book!!!

momomojojo," What a waste of time, the other way around geographically","Too unrealistic movie, with too much special effect that they do not bother to cover up. Humoristic moments do not seem that funny. Also, how a thin someone holdoff a big guy?Ugh, it is that classic moves of Hollywood and phrases. Like the headphone did not hear you. Or foreigner moving oversea. Suddenly it looks like how they are picturing America especially in the cab. Like your pants joke, hell no phrase when looking at height. Or was looking everywhere for you. Burn it down. Classic moves like using multiple people as a stair.Hate it also that sometimes they just speak English but mostly Chinese, wondering what they want.How much did the Chinese pay Disney?Using big actors and adding a new guy in to keep the quality of the acting, with a bad script it does not do well. Especially when there is no innovative action in the players. They were copy and paste from another movie they played before.Classic scenarios making it so predictable, and fights that could not be won due to lack of experience are own suddenly.Acting is below average, quality of screen is high but too much special effect, camera work is OK because it has gotten took over multiple of times by special effects so can not give any real points. Sound is below average because they're using too much overused kinds.1 time only movie. Points are given to the cast because they still try to make something out of it but still not pulling tit off and meeting the script only. Some points for the innovativeness idea.",20 December 2021
brianbarnett-492-73980, Juvenile. Cartoonish. Set in a rathole city.,"Disclaimer #1: I'm simply burned out on Marvel. I'm a lifelong fan of cinema, but I'm not a purist to the extent that I feel I have to choose between Scorsese OR Superheroes. Sometimes I'm in the mood for one and sometimes I'm in the mood for the other. Disclaimer #2: I was an avid comic book collector from the time I was about 10 until I was about 38. In fact, I made an oath to myself in my younger years that I would never stop loving comics and comic books. Disclaimer #3: I'm now 46 at the time of this writing. I've done a lot of growing up since I stopped collecting comics, and even more growing up since I was 10. I'm not a Kevin Smith. Kevin Smith is a loser. And this is just my opinion, so take it however you want, but the adults running around living for this endless stream of cinematic crap, doing YouTube reaction videos for trailers, and their subscribers are also losers. (I'm trying for the Guinness Book Record of downvotes here.)I tried to give this movie a chance because it was free on Disney + (which I only have for my 6-year-old daughter) and I was bored to death within 10 minutes. Not just bored to death but knowing I was wasting my time on just more juvenile garbage. So I turned it off. Then I was with my daughter, and I thought, ""Aha! I know just the movie she would love to see!"" And guess what? She thinks it's amazing.So there you go, losers. All of you grown people are delirious over a cartoon for 6 year olds. Congratulations.Oh, and I've been to San Fran, and it was a rathole 15 years ago. I hear it's even rat holier now.

Darkjak007, The Master of Kung-fu,"Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco. Working as a Valet parking car, and partying late nights with his best friend Katy(Awkwafina). Until one day a band of assassins targets Shang and it's revealed that he's actually an assassin trained at birth by his father Wenwu(Tony Leung Chiu-Wai). The leader of the ten rings an ancient Chinese organization that's existence for thousands of years, conquering kingdoms and overthrowing governments. Now Shang-Chi must faces his father and overcome the demons of his past. Each of these Marvel films I find most enjoyable is the world building, set up of this universal series. All these characters from various backgrounds and classes and worlds. Shang-Chi I can say is one of those welcome new additions. Similar to Guardians of the galaxy when this was announced I hadn't the slightest idea who this guy was. Usually when people think Martial artists with marvel they usually think Iron fist or daredevil. So going into this I had a blank expectation of what to see. It does pay tribute to old-school martial arts films while mixing fast action charm of a comic book with a blend of Chinese mythology and philosophy. It does helps gives the movie an identity and the characters overall I found them good not great, but I found them entertaining and likable. Shang's more or less just an ordinary guy just trying to live his life. Have fun make a new start and make the best of it. He's honestly more or less happy with his basic life. Though at the same time running from his old life his father,mother and sister. It all leaves an impact on him as a person. He's pretty emotional not Peter Parker emotional, but he still has a personality outside of just having a stoic Shaolin fighter serious persona. They could have easily done a chosen one theme with him that been done to death. He likes to joke and have fun along with his friend Katy. Awkwafina I'm not a fan of her I didn't really care for her in crazy Rich Asians or Raya and the last dragon. Here I found her character more funny and likable. She doesn't really come off as that annoying friend that's more or less in the way. Her and Simu do play well off each other and display this friendship of two different people who still very similar. I got sort of Rush hour vibe off them, there's even a fight scene outside on a bamboo scaffolding. She's not just a pointless tagalong she does have moments where the jokes don't work , though she does add to the film specifically in the finale. The tone of the movie still finds time to flesh them out. More or less the two of them are just goofballs at the beginning, once more's revealed it does take time to have it's more deep serious moments. Wenwu I found to be a really good villain and While technically this still isn't really the Mandarin that comic readers we're probably expecting. His overall character is very compelling he more borders the line like killmonger. You understand his reasons though his actions are unjustifiable. He does still manages to gives off this somewhat opposing demeanor not from his fighting, but from the way he present his self. I buy this guy used to be a tyrant and a Conqueror. I still wish his rings worked the same way though, really he just throws them like chakra and whips them around. As for the sister she's given minimal in this not really alot of moments. Outside of her childhood flash backstory it's clear later down the road their gonna do something her. The visuals are stunning to this one water effect the just pops off the screen. The use of elements being shown through the right use of slow motion. The landscape of Tao lo which has this very traditional Chinese style with Nine-tail foxes, and Fu dog(lions) that make that the rhinos from black panther looks bad. I want to see more places like this in future installments. A lot of these cg effects are on par with doctor strange.",19 November 2021

Oh wait are you saying he was there just so they could shoehorn in another MCU character because this movie is so bad it had to find a way to make people smile? Yeah. TrashBonus: Ben Kingsley was the best and only good thing about this film. His character has been redeemed.",9 February 2022
jessicashanley, Typical and Bland (But take it with a grain of salt),"Simply put, this movie was bland. Plot follow a simple acceptance plot, of Shang learning to accept he is his father's son, with no surprising twists or changes to the plot to make it better. Shang himself seems to be watching everything instead of actually interacting with his world. Action scenes were choreographed well, yet never seemed to fit for some reason. The ending was anticlimactic, and I expected more of a ending fight with the big bad. Visually speaking the movie is gorgeous, but i wouldn't watch it for the visuals. Shang as a character is bland and boring. The only character I felt was developed well was Shang's Father. Side characters are forgettable. If you are a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then don't watch it as it doesn't fit at all in the timeline, with excessive fantasy elements that don't fit in the universe. Take this review with a grain of salt, as i went into this movie with higher expectations, but these are flaws i saw as i watched the film. Thank you for your time.",6 September 2021

csmaros," Enjoyable, but Disneyfied","Felt more like a Disney production than a MCU movie. The supernatural aspects especially seem like they were sourced from a Disney workflow.Good character development, especially for the Mandarin, but some stuff seemed glossed over. The final ""Boss Battle"" was a bit of CGI overload, at least for me. Much more than any other MCU movie.Despite my specific picks at the movie, it's very enjoyable. From an Americana perspective, I'd put it a bit below Black Panther. At the time of this review words have been said that makes any followup of this movie questionable at best.There are two trailers, one middle, one ending. Interesting fluff but not important. Especially since such a followup may not happen.",15 September 2021

-great Casting (SImu Liu, Tony Lueng). Especially Tony Lueng because he look badass and has
great acting skill.-You've already heard people praising the film's action choreography, and it's well-deserved. It
doesn't has many cut scenes like many MCU fighting scenes.-This film felt completely unique from what we've seen from the MCU already.-Props to the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack as well, they were great!-The first two act was incredible and amazing showing the life of Shang-Chi, how Wenwu meet
his wife etc. This type of act is something MCU usually doesn't have.-This film open up MCU to new world with myth creature, many evil organization, and the
mystery of the Ten Rings.NEGATIVE
-The casting was STELLAR. Aside from the one person I didn't care for (*Razor Fist, cough
cough*) everybody played their roles to perfection.-The jokes may not be funny to some people. But It's funny to me.-The only issue I had with Shang-Chi was the third act. Not that it was bad, but it felt
detracting from what the first 2/3rds of the movie established. It become every MCU logic
part(CGI BATTLE). It took away from the great hand-to-hand action stunt work, but it's to be
expected from a film of this genre.The exposition can be a bit heavy but understandably needed to introduce a brand newcharacter into this universe.IMO

pjanesbrown, Stunningly Beautiful in every way.,"Destin Daniel Cretton, who mentored who mentored two academy award winners, Brie Larson and Rami Malek and another Academy Award nominee, Lakieth Stanfield has demonstrated he has no limitations. Two years in the making Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings delivers on every cylinder and it has at least 16.You will find yourself laughing out loud a lot! You will be dazzled by the remarkable beauty and you will be transfixed by the fight scenes. Especially the ones between Shang Chi's, (Simu Liu) mother, Jiang Li (Fala Chen) and his father, Wen Wu (Tony Leung) stunningly beautiful choreography, his sister,Xiangling (Meng'er Zhang) and finally, the one between his aunt.

geddyneilalex28, All style little substance,"I think this was ok. Not as bad as Black Widow, or Iron Man 2, but definitely in the bottom tier of the MCU.Marvel seems to have forgotten what made most of phases 1-3 so much fun.....the movies used to clever, funny, and while far fetched, at least consistent.This flick is all over the map. Marvel is trying so hard to be woke enough for Twitter, that they are not focused on quality anymore. Black Panther ruled not because the cast was almost all black, it ruled because it was an awesome movie that happened to have a mostly black cast.I feel like these characters desired more than muddled messy film so focused on spotlighting how cool Marvel is for focusing on Asian casting, instead of started from, let's tell a good story first, and cast it with the right representation.Hopefully, phase 4 and beyond will get better, but so far...I think Marvel may be at the end of its ability to dominate cinemas.",26 November 2021
popitotoro, Bad at all levels,"Too long, too little story, bad CGI (except for the D*****, which was good), too many hollow and/or annoying dialogues.We were bored during the whole movie, painfully realizing how empty it was going to be after the plot is finally revealed, after 20 minutes of waiting where the heck this movie was trying to take us.Don't bother.",12 November 2021

This is such a great movie.",4 September 2021
allismile," Starts off Well, but Middle/End Ho-Hum","There is something about the recent marvel movies that I don't like. Maybe it's because I had never heard of many of the characters before, but maybe that's because they just aren't as interesting as the most well known characters in the marvel cannon.Whatever it is, I enjoyed Shang-Chi a lot more than the previous lesser known characters movies Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Black Panther (those were terrible). Although I did like Ant-Man and Guardians Of The Galaxy because of the humor gave the characters more personality, and Doctor Strange was just wonderfully strange and well fleshed out. But I really did not like Avengers Infinity Wars/Endgame- what a headache in story telling those were. They had their moments all the same.Anyway...
I say all that as a baseline for where I'm coming from with my perspective on Shang-Chi.I went into this with my eyes ready to roll, but was pleasantly surprised. There was a solid infusion of humor with Awkafina (who has grown on me quite a bit), and an interesting back story with the main character's family, and his power ""reveal"" was a real highlight.The story just got a little flat half way through- perhaps the premise leading up to it was just not strong enough, and that could do with his character not being that complex. There seemed to be very little inner conflict with the main character that hasn't been done a million times in some sort of super hero story.",14 November 2021
thaboruge, Love it,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a superhero movie. It's a part of the next phase of the MCU.As first we need to look up the major role, which Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has to fulfill. It's a whole new franchise and has to introduce a new universe, new characters and a new superhero for the MCU. That's not that easy, to accomplish all of these duties and create a good piece of art. But Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings definitely did it pretty well.The new universe and the new characters getting introduced very pleasant. There is no rushing or plot gaps. Also the origin story is kinda complex, but still interesting. There are many different interrelations between the characters.I mostly enjoyed the different fighting scenes, cause the CGI was brilliant and there was no shaky cam. The camera was focused on the different fights and never was getting shaky or blurred. This causes, that every fight was very intense. I guess especially in 3D in the cinema the movie could be stunning.It's kinda hard for me to describe the plot, but in general Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings follow a basic superhero story. We have different heroes and different antagonist, which fight against each other. Of course there are different backgrounds, but they just fulfill the story.From my point of view Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a very catchy MCU movie. It's also a great movie to represent the Asian-Chinese culture in America and in superhero movies.",18 January 2022

2021
12A
director: Destin Daniel Cretton
starring: Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Ben Kingsley, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Michelle Yeoh, Wah Yeun, Florian Munteanu etcShang Chi (Simu Liu) the master of unarmed weaponry-based kung fu. Is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the ten rings organisation. Wow what a film Shang Chi was and one of the strongest additions to the MCU.My first few positives would be the character background and set up. As well as the fantastic cinematography, worldbuilding and action. As well as the likeable characters and performances. I really liked that the film went into the character background for the Mandarin and the mythology of the ten rings and how he got them, with an action packed and well explained opening sequence that set the tone for the film very well, offering something different from the MCU from the very first scene. I also thought the set up was strong, the film established Shang Chi and his life without his dad excellently, making you connect to the characters, but also did a great job at setting up the villain's intentions well and developing the plot nicely. The cinematography in this film had to be some of the most beautiful visuals I have seen from the MCU. There were so many beautifully shot scenes especially within the action scenes with mid or long shots where you could actually see what was happening. The colour grading and scope of the film was seriously impressive, I was in awe. I also thought the action was probably the strongest I have seen from the MCU. The action was incredibly choreographed, very entertaining, and incorporated Asian culture and kung fu and they were so well shot it was one of the films strongest elements. The worldbuilding was also very strong. This film introduced us to such a rich and beautiful new world, it was beautiful and well explained and really explored in a lot of detail but left more to be explored for the future. This film was like seeing Wakanda for the first time. The film had such likeable characters. Particularly with Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) all of the new characters introduced were instantly likeable and I connected with them quickly. This was also helped by the fantastic Chemistry between the whole cast, everyone worked amazing together, especially Simu Liu and Awkwafina who were both amazing here, and did amazing performances. They both had loads of charm and charisma. Other cast standouts were Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh and Menger Zhang.My next few positives would be the humour and sound design. The family dynamic and character depth. As well as the fun cameos and Plot twists. The soundtrack for the film was also excellent, it gave the action scenes in particular an intense atmosphere and really elevated a lot of the scenes well. I really liked the family dynamic the film had. Having the villain be Shang Chi's father and his mother and sister be involved was a great idea. It made the film more personal to the characters and increased the stakes for the characters, they had a connection and the conflict between the different members of the family was very well written. This gave characters like Shang Chi and the Mandarin a lot more character depth. The mandarin was so crushed by his wife's death because she made him a good man, and his quest to find his wife really gave him some emotional depth, and Shang Chi's attempt to live a normal life and escape his father's shadow, but also look for his dads love and acceptance was really well handled, as well as his character decisions involving his sister and his regret over his mother gave his character a good amount of layers. The cameos in this film were a lot of fun, there was a few easter eggs sprinkled throughout but it still felt like its own film. But having Wong back was a great surprise and that was in the trailer so not a spoiler. I also thought the plot twists were strong. The twists involving the family's secrets and the new world were well executed, unexpected and added some great layers to the film, it never once got boring.I did have a few minor issues. The villain was underused going into the final act, there was a few issues with the creative decisions in the final act. And there was a slight overusage of flashbacks. I did find that the mandarin was taken out of a big chunk of the film in order to delay the final act and expand the story world more, it would have been nice for his character to be incorporated within the plot as a whole instead of being used for more flashbacks. I did find that there were too many flashbacks. A lot of them served the plot well and had purpose, but some of them felt unneeded and repetitive and were occasionally jarring. There were just a few creative decisions in the final act I wasn't fond of. There was some overusage of CGI that took me out of a couple of scenes, and there was a deux ex Machina with Katy that was slightly cheesy to me.My final few positives would be the set pieces. Great development to the plot and balance to the villain. As well as interesting elements, great dialogue, and a great final act. The films set locations were beautiful, they really captured the magic of the world as well as Asian culture, the representation for the Asian community in this film was excellent. The plot development was also excellent, the twists gave the film multiple layers to work with, and the different acts flowed well, with constant new elements being added to keep the film feeling fresh. I also thought the film did an excellent job at making the audience sympathise with the Mandarin but also making it clear he was still the villain, as the film showed what kind of man he used to be with his wife I understood him wanting to be reunited with her, but the film excellently balanced this with his cruel and controlling behaviour to make him one of the strongest villains I have seen in a while in the MCU. I also thought there was a lot of interesting elements to the story world. The world of Ta lo was fascinating, and the film went into great detail of the culture and the lives of the people living there which was fascinating. The dialogue was also great, raising great themes of acceptance, family and grief that was excellently told through the lines of dialogue that felt personal to the characters and were very well written. The final act was also amazing. They went all out with the visuals and action. In a thrilling, exciting and breath-taking final act that conclude the story and the character arcs excellently and setting up Chang Chi's future in the MCU very well.Overall, Shang Chi has a few structure issues and falls into some MCU tropes with the CGI in the final act. But this film was visually stunning, with some of the best worldbuilding and action from the MCU. With star making performances from Simu Liu and Awkwafina. Also, with amazing Asian representation. This has really taken the MCU in a different direction and is one of their strongest origin stories.Overall rating 92/100.",5 September 2021
prabhu-08180, A new era for Marvel!,"This film contains everything you hope for in a marvel movie. Acting, direction, cinematography, music everything has perfectly blended in this film. Martial arts action sequences with magical mythical creatures and comedic sequences and family sentiments, it is a complete package.

Definitely marvel phase 4 movies are gonna be lit, and this movie has done a great job in introducing it.",3 September 2021
Polotovar, Dragons in Marvel movie!,"I'm not gonna lie. The movie didn't impress me much based on the trailer. I still wanted to see it because, well, Marvel movies are just fine and I believed it would be good. And it was. It was. The story, in my opinion, wasn't as good as it usually is with Marvel. Not that Marvel has any masterful storylines, but it just wasn't as good in my opinion as some of the other movies that have come out from the studio in the past. What was more than good, on the other hand, was the music in places. But what was without a doubt the best and what Marvel has always been able to do and probably always will be able to do is action. The action scenes here are awesome, although then they are not very frequent. There are a few times when the pace slows down and we wait for some of the fights. Once it does though, you're in for an epic CGI load of fighting that I devoured. There's still the occasional quirk thrown in here and there, as is usually the case with Marvel movies. To sum it up. For me, a good movie that I recommend, and classically to Marvel fans.",27 September 2021
sagor_9364, Visually Stunning,"Well definitely the best production by marvel following Endgame. An absolute treat to watch. The main attraction is obviously the amazing fight sequence that's up there with the best fight scenes of MCU, and also the background music is perfectly fitting to the tone and setting of the film. What many might think that the plotline does not have enough depth. But I'd beg to differ as the way they've changed the Shang Chi character, introducing his father as the wielder of the ten rings and changing the power of the rings altogether is an amazing approach itself. The merging of different components and changing the storyline from the comics has been common in the MCU but none of them is as unique as shang chi. I'd say if they brought the original shang chi from the comics, then it would've been a mediocre movie. But they made every character unique, even the villain has a backstory to which everyone can relate. The fight sequences give goosebumps everytime I watch 'em. Can't wait for the sequel!!!",19 November 2021

srawrats," Outside the typical superhero movie, more fantasy/supernatural, but I liked it.","I didn't know what to expect going in, superhero? Martial arts? And to me it ended up being more fantasy/supernatural than superhero. That being said, I liked it and I was entertained, it had a strange 80's vibe to me and I had feelings at times like I have seen this before...probably just me. The story was good, acting was good, visuals were spectacular, the middle did kinda drag a little, but overall it was a good movie.If you're looking for a martial arts movie, it's not Enter the Dragon and it's certainly not superhero like Spider-man or Superman. It's different, fresh, and I can see why many will love it. You could hate superheroes in general and still love this movie, so it would be a shame for people to avoid this movie because they don't like Superhero movies. I say give it a shot, but don't expect anything like Enter the Dragon or Superman, you will be disappointed.",6 September 2021

Silicone54, Feel a bit let down,"I am no longer a fan of superhero movies as I was in the past. This is a prelude to a full tie in to MCU which is the only reason I watched it before it gets lost in that mess.While I enjoyed the story of the fantasy village of Ta Lo, it will be a shame to see them wrapped into MCU. I would much rather see characters such as Thor in Asgard, Black Panther in Wakanda, Spiderman in Queens etc. I think that's where their stories flourish and not get watered down as bit parts.I understand packing in as many superhero characters into a movie guarantees there is something for everyone. Fans that prefer to follow their favorite hero lose out in these money grabs.This movie was not too sophisticated and relied on visuals to carry the movie. I really enjoyed the comedy pairing of the leads. Unfortunately, I doubt they will make another Shang Chi movie which is too bad.",11 November 2021

rfloom," Top 5 MCU films for me, maybe top 3","This film isn't perfect, I felt like they honestly could have kept it going with the feel of the first half of the film and maybe save the more mystical special effects for a sequel, kind of felt like 2 movies jammed together. But regardless, both halves were great. I think the first half was a bit better and the ending got a bit jumbled with the CGI, but I feel like the more I watch it and am able to process everything the more I'll love it. All I know is I can't wait to watch it again, and I can't wait to see Shang-Chi with the other MCU heroes. Wenwu is one of the best MCU villains so far, maybe the best after Thanos. The humor was fantastic and the bus scene is probably one of the best scenes in the MCU. Choreography was brilliant, cinematography as well. I will say I wish they saved Razor Fist as a future villain (but then we wouldn't have gotten the insane bus scene), and definitely wish they went all out for Death Dealer, or saved him for a sequel as well. I thought he was such a badass character that we only got to see the tip of the iceberg of his potential. Super unique design to him. I do kind of wish Shang-Chi had a superhero name of some sort, kind of throws me off that his Marvel title is just his name, but I guess that's the case for Thor and Loki too. And some of the Netflix heroes if you count them. Anyways I'm really nitpicking now. But great MCU film. Still feels pretty formulaic, but it's own thing at the same time.",8 October 2021
neilbowers, Ignore the 1* reviews. This is so much better than they're saying.,"I went to watch Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings last night and it does not disappoint at all.This is a character I am not very familiar with in regards to the MCU. However, having watched it, I hope we see more of him sooner rather than later.The film starts with how Shang-Chi's father Wenwu discovered the 10 Rings and used them to topple governments and change the outcome of certain world events. Then how he wants to try and find the mystical village of Tao Lo as this is the last area of the world he hasn't conquered.Eventually finding the entrance to the lost village he finds a young lady guarding the entrance. In time they fall in love and he gives up the 10 Rings to be with her.Cut to 1996 and they're living in married bliss with baby Shang-Chi having been born and his sister soon after. They're given two pendants but their mother as we discover that she was killed and her father took up the 10 Rings again.We then discover a grown up Shang-Chi (Or Shaun as he is now known) living in San Francisco as a car valet with his friend Katy (played brilliantly by the actress Awkwafina). As they're travelling to work on a bus henchmen sent by his father attack him. What follows is a very well choreographed fight seen and lots of destruction.Realising the pendent has been stolen by the henchmen Shaun races back home to his apartment to grab clothes for a flight to Macau. To try and save his sister from losing her pendent.Not wishing to miss out, Katy insists on joining Shaun for the ride. On the flight over Shaun explains he is not the man who Katy thought he was and explains his past.When he arrives in Macau he goes to the address on a postcard which he assumed was sent by his sister. It turns out his sister runs an illegal fight club where huge amounts of betting takes place inside and online.Shaun is already well known thanks to a YouTube video of his exploits in San Francisco going viral. He also finds out he is going to be the main attraction and lots of money has already been bet on him.A fight is already going on and a familiar face is taking part. I will not spoil that bit for you. As he goes into the ring the opponent appears and it turns out to be his sister.Chaos then ensues as the same henchmen have arrived at the illegal fighting den after the second pendent. The fight scenes which take place on scaffolding between Shaun, his sister and his fathers henchmen are breath taking and it really makes you feel as though you're high up on the side of a building.They're eventually captured and taken back to their former home. When it is explained that their dad hears their mum calling to him and he believes she is still alive but being kept captive by the elders in Tao-Lo. He must go and find Tao-Lo but can only find the correct path once a year and that time is soon.Meanwhile he locks all 3 up in a dungeon as they will not help him go and find their mother. What follows is absolutely hilarious as an old character from the Iron Man franchise makes an appearance.While they're in the dungeon they're introduced to a creature from Tao-Lo called Morris and they find out from this creature that there is a much quicker way to get to Tao-Lo. So, stealing a car, they head to the lost village.Upon arriving they meet their Aunt who is also mourning the loss of her sister. They are told about and ancient evil that eats souls and many cities fell to it and was only defeated by the help of a dragon. Shang Chi and Xialing are given dragon scale armor (a gift from their mother). Katy trains with a bow and arrow and Shaun trains with his aunt to learn the dragon magic fighting style.The 10 Rings then attack the village with Shaun fighting his father first on the side of the lake which he is then sent crashing into. While unconscious under water he learns his power can call the guardian dragon.Meanwhile at the entrance of the of the cave where his father believes his mother is calling from. His father can be seen trying to break into the cave. Which eventually releases bat like creatures that suck up the souls of individuals.Continuing to try and release his wife. Wenwu releases the mother of all beasts and a battle ensues. Sadly we see Wenwu killed as his soul is sucked out by one of the bat like creatures. But, not before himself and Shaun battle it out against each other. Upon his death, the 10 Rings are passed on to Shaun. The battle comes to an end and the villagers mourn the loss of those lost in battle.We then get taken back to San Francisco where Shaun and Katy are telling their story to two friends who look at them as though they're going mad and in fact one complains that she is having the mickey taken out of her.The closing scene sees a popular character appear and both Shaun and Katy follow them. Which gives a clue I suspect as to how phase 4 will pan out in the future of the MCU.There are two closing credit scenes. One where we find both Shaun and Katy in a building and other Marvel characters have appeared. Again, this shows where the MCU is going.The second involves his sister.. but that is all I will reveal as this will also show what I think is going to be the direction of the MCU.There are little snippets within the film that also mention past events. Can you hear and find them?Overall this is a brilliant film! Some very good special effects. The music score is good. Some very funny characters too. I think this is a very good start to Phase 4 and miles better than Black Widow.As my title suggests please ignore the 1 * reviews on here. I suspect they're DC fans in disguise trying to make MCU look bad. But, by all means read them and make up your own mind by going to watch Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",10 September 2021
tawfiktjmohamed, Underestimated,I saw all the trailers and all the press for the movie but wasn't that hyped for it if I'm being honest. Then I saw the movie and I must say...expectations were blown out of the water. The movie was great and something quite unique and refreshing for the mcu. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend.,3 September 2021

vfgsszb, Meh,"Not sure what all the hype is about as far as non Asian movie goers are concerned. The movie was ok at best. It has some great fight scenes, ok comedy, and great cinematography,(it's Marvel after all) but over it's kinda dumb. The first part of the movie is pretty good, the second half all the way to the end is pretty ridiculous. I won't give away anything here. My wife is Asian, so I went with her family to see it last night. It was all Asians in the theatre besides a few white people. I asked my sister-in-law why she liked it so much, and her reason was ""because I'm Asian."" That's exactly how Obama became President, and why black panther did well at the box office, because minorities support minorities whether the finished product is good or not. It's rather annoying, and I don't care who gets offended reading this, because it's fact! All the big babies will down vote this, but they know I'm right. Marvel needs to get back to making awesome movies like Thor Ragnarok, and Endgame. The Hulk movies, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Shang-Chi ain't it, sorry not sorry.",29 September 2021

coombsstephen, Very good film with a novel concept,"I thought this film was a good break from the usual marvel super hero films, it was much more traditional martial arts film combined with some modern aspects.The concept was good and the film went along at a great pace. There was some good humour as well.I would really recommend it.",11 September 2021
Celewa, B+ (flat 8). September 21' @Regal,"Strong camerawork, especially during action sequences. Action sequences are engaging and creative. Very little bloat with narrative..

CinemaClown," A Fun, Pleasant & Satisfying Delight","Despite following the Marvel formula to a tee, Shang-Chi & the Legend of the Ten Rings manages to bring a certain freshness to its cinematic universe with its expertly choreographed moments of action and a fully committed Asian ensemble led by Tony Leung. The film isn't without its shortcomings and also gets carried away with its CGI set pieces during the final act but the journey as a whole remains a mostly fun, amusing & satisfying affair. Definitely amongst the better entries in the Marvel canon.",11 November 2021

Ravelund, Maybe it is time for a Marvel pause,"This movie basically lacks all that can make a greate movie.Asian mythology is so rich. This move is not.* Story is boring.* Script is so thin, that even the actors looks realy stiff and bad.* It is basically no fun.* It feels like 3,5 hours long.* CGI Effects at times seems very bad and distracting.* On top of that it is spiced up with modern day politics and it feels very forced.Time for a long pause Marvel, to regroup. This is getting very bad.",6 March 2022
its_me_rajit, Welcome new breed of superheroes,"Through this movie it looks like Marvel is trying to create a new breed and a new universe. This is a post apocalyptic world where Thanos's snap has already worked (There are few easter eggs there if you want to find out). Shang-chi needs to fight with his own to save his world. The prop used are the rings. Pleasantly surprised that Marvel is finally trying to bring the inclusion in superheroes through ""Captain Marvel"",""Black Panther"" and now ""Shang-Chi"".Marvel fans will definitely watch whatever I review so review is worthless . Despite of that I gave a try.And yes How many times did you think about Kims convenience while watching this movie? ;)",3 February 2022
snoozejonc, An easy watch that fits into the MCU well,"A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference. What is presented is not complicated in anyway, but very simplified, presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of Shang-Chi and Katy can share screens with other MCU characters as soon as possible.The tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'Black Panther', particularly when it focusses on a location that, like Wakanda, mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci-fi fantasy. It has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far-Eastern culture like martial arts, traditional costuming, rural settings, that is marketable to a Western audience, but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents, sorcery, yellow peril, bad driving, and (thankfully) gong sounds. Much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast-talking contemporary American humour.There are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus, the various comedy moments, virtually everything that comes out of Ben Kingsley's mouth, and all the flashback scenes. The final dinner table scene is probably my favourite.Visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography, editing, and technology-driven effects. For me though the spectacle goes over-the-top, particularly in the final action sequence.Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema.",15 November 2021
EddyTheMartian007," Quickie: One of the more enjoyable MCU movies in a while, the best Phase 4 project, but still not remarkable.","Shang Chi does what most of the MCU does well, and without too many dumb moments or flaws to bring it down. It even exceeded in areas like the fight scenes, which are easily the best in the MCU, and even some of the humor. Those fights were very well choreographed, well shot, and even very creative at times. Despite going back to the big CGI battles by the end of it, it was still done far better than most in the MCU. And while not all the humor lands, I will say that it was probably funnier than most MCU movies, especially with the inclusion of Trevor Slattery, who was hilarious. Did not expect to enjoy him so much.However while it's superficially very good, it was still mostly a very basic MCU film. It lacked a lot of depth that stopped it from being more than just pretty good or decent. There were a ton of flashbacks and exposition dumps about the lore that got a bit too repetitive, but at the same time I wish they delved more into it. Honestly I feel like this movie would've worked better as a 3 hour epic. The first half focuses on Wenwu in the past. We get to see from his perspective why he wanted so much power and to conquer, all the lore gets shown to us without needing to explain it, then see how he changes through the romance, and finally see how he raised his children, how that all played out with time and care. Then the second part of the movie switches to the present which delves deeper into examining how Wenwu affected his children, how they dealt with it, the generational divide, etc. And imagine the 2 protagonists of each half going against each other. There's so much to explore there thematically with parenting, violence, culture, growth, etc. But not much is done. Obviously my idea is too much to ask for, but I just thought that this movie lacked a lot of depth. We get the basics of the characters, but not much more. These characters have some of the most simple and basic arcs.MCU fans have been so deprived of good villains they thought Wenwu was refreshing even though he's extremely cliched, and made okay just because of the great Tony Leung. Another amazing actor wasted, but at least he was better than the average MCU villain. Overall this movie gets back to what the MCU was known for, and it succeeds better in some aspects too, first good project in Phase 4! But it also lacks some of the depth that could've made this one of the best MCU movies, making me think it won't hold up as well on rewatch.(6.9/10)Note: This is an old review I had in my notes I didn't originally post because I would eventually add more to it, but since I haven't yet I thought might as well do so.",1 March 2022
frank-harte, Great great,"Film is great overrall, same story we all know but the way it told is engaging and emotional, first thing i loved in this movie is action sequence, every action scene is so damn good. The soundtrack is amazing. The characters are well written, even a smaller role is kinda memorable, vfx is great but not in high standards in final climax, its not that messy but notable, there are two credits scenes dont miss that. It does what it meant to do(entertainment). Cant wait for further mcu movies.",18 November 2021
mrashtastic89, It came out of nowhere and it was absolutely awesome,"This is my favorite Marvel movie since Black Panther and it's the best Marvel movie of 2021 right behind No Way Home.The fight scenes and direction were epic, the entire time I was watching this movie I thought to myself, ""maybe they can make a good live action Dragon Ball movie"", if they ever do, they should have Destin Daniel Crettin direct it, he's a master of action and humor.This movie is even funnier than Guardians of the Galaxy, one of Marvel's funniest movies.Simu Liu and Ben Kingsley were fantastic in this film, Kingsley was hilarious and Liu brought a real sense of passion to one of my favorite Marvel superheroes.Awkwafina did a great comedic job, her character was hilarious.Shang-Chi is a nonstop action packed thrill ride from the first frame to the last, every second is rooted with either action, humor, backstory, or all of the above, I can't get over just how good the fight scenes are, along with the incredible finale, amazing cinematography, and breathtaking special effects.This is one of the best MCU movies, and I'm gonna give it an A.",5 March 2022
margineanvladdaniel, Very decent and swell,"It took marvel again some time to make a appreciating movie. Well done, I liked the kung-fu fightings, really cool and not forced or over exaggerated and most importantly, fluent and not much slowed down. It lacked something, otherwise I would have rated it higher. Of course there was awkward silence moments just like in marvel movies, but that's me and were expected. Hope they will do more movies like these.",16 November 2021
inactivekick-76609, An Instant Classic,"Typically, there's a line to be drawn between mixing genres, and to a certain degree Shang-Chi and the Legend could easily be categorized as being just another knock-off of the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon type Chinese legend tale.But thankfully, MARVEL were (more than ) able to avoid that mistake. They achieved this by making sure to meld only the best aspects of Chinese martial arts culture with the best aspects of Marvel Universe, superhero tenets.I won't include spoilers, suffice to say, this turned out to be an epic display of action, fantasy, thriller and just enough lighter humor to not come across as try hard, cheesy.In all, if you're a fan of both Chinese martial arts, fantasy-legend and Marvel Universe, you will almost definitely enjoy, what i can easily see (imho) as becoming a classic.",8 January 2022
andybambi-22722, Entertaining and fun,"I think the best way to describe this movie is The Matrix meets Kung Fu PandaThis is a great movie! The action sequences are spectacular and even though there is lot going on in them, unlike some other epic battle scenes in movies where you lose track of what's happening, these are filmed in such a way that it's really easy to follow and make out what's going. The cinematography is spot on with plenty of slow motion which is just as well because the speed these guys move is phenomenal and breath-taking at times. Bruce Lee would approve.The acting is good all round and the characters a good and relatable to. Over all it's a visually spectacular experience and all fans of Marvel or martial arts will enjoy it.",15 March 2022

tadpole-596-918256," Mobile trees, magic rings, threatening dragons . . .",". . . haven't we heard all of this before? China is infamous for intellectual property theft, with TEN RINGS being a sterling example of such nefarious cultural shoplifting. Seldom credited with any originality beyond propagating Germs of Mass Destruction, it would surprise no one if this outlaw band of grifters opened up a fast food restaurant chain tomorrow selling warm dogs and ""Chinese fries"" under some Silver Arches.

phoenixinvictus, It's a Kung-Fu movie,"If it didn't have Marvel on it then this would have been another kung-fu movie.

Afterwards he falls in love and hangs up his rings for love and family. I didn't buy it...

The doors of what is possible in the MCU has been truly kicked off it's hinges!Guaranteed come Monday morning, kids around the world will be busting their parents chops to get into a Martial Art class. Marvels newest addition to the live action roster will have the same impact as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan had on many here growing up. It's a certainty.Action scenes are aplenty and jaw dropping. I have seen way too many Martial Art movies but this for sheer creativity is up there with the best. Score is beautifully written. Story although predictable, does what it needs to do without grinding the movie to a halt. Acting is top notch especially with the lead Simu Liu and Tony Leung Chui-wai.If I had one bad thing to say about it, it's this...

Don't get me wrong, I had fun with the movie in general, but possibly I won't see it again anytime soon.I liked the fight choreography, Tony Leung was fantastic, Awkwafina was really funny and charming, but Simu Liu was kind of serviceable. The story could have had more impact, but I think it was sabotaged a little bit by the levity of the Marvel formula.The direction and photography are great, especially in the Macau scenes, but Ta-Lo's magical setting didn't work for me.A lot of people will definitely love this movie, and I understand why.

miss_ilda, Nice kung-fu scenes...,"The movie had nice kung-fu scenes and nice fighting effects. But overall it was underwhelming.First of all, was I the only one who was annoyed byt Katys character. I didn't understand why she even was in the movie. She didn't contribute to the storyline at all. She was just an annoying side chick with unnecessary and unneeded comments of what was going on. I wanted to turn off the movie every time she opened her mouth. So why the heck would Marvel make her in to a canon????And second off, it was a very jumpy storyline. Some things did not add up. Like why the heck did Shang-Chis mother fall in love with his father. Especially after he said that he was there to conquer her village. Like, her first thought went to playing tricks on him and eventually dancing with him instead of trying to protect her village from him. Like, say what???Overall a mellow movie.

Monarch_1, A Perfect Marvel Solo origin movie,"The journey of a self doubting and traumatized person into confident saviour of the world. Now add in some loyal characters who always believe in the protagonist's ability and some humour, now you have Marvel's good old formula for Solo origin movies.Marvel has perfected this formula and it works. It is fun to watch Simu Liu's Shang-Chi growing into the worthy hero to possess legendary ten rings. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's Wen wu easily dominates the screen presence and leaves lasting impression on the viewers. Ageless Michelle yeoh does her part very well and Awkwafina is....there.Besides the Captain America and the winter soldier, this movie has some of the best hand to hand combat scenes in the whole MCU. The Mid credits scene was a surprise and Marvel fans, Don't miss it.While the movie is not boring, it doesn't take risks and doesn't venture into unique and bold story telling like GOTG, Infinity war and Endgame. If you have watched both trailers for this movie, you pretty much know what's gonna happen after spending 15 mins into the movie.Overall, Shang-Chi is a worthy addition to the MCU (Or should I say MCM 😉? ) and a decent movie to visit theatres after two long years.",6 September 2021
williamstara-63221, Marvel does not disappoint.,"I admit the script was pretty cheesy and basic but everything else was quite Brilliant & Beautiful. This is coming from a Marvel fan.

awesomeadam-88354, An below average marvel film,"This film had some very funny and unique moments in it, but overall I think the story was quite weak and there weren't any moments where I was fully into the movie. I think sequels could have good potential but I left the cinema without much excitement. Don't get me wrong it's a good movie but there are so many marvel films that top this one in storyline and character developed ect. I think 6 is a reasonable score I would give 6.5 if this were an option but 7 is a bit generous. Don't believe these 10/10 reviews. 10 is reserved for cinematic masterpieces like the dark night or infinity war.",4 September 2021
dilipbts, Shang-chi and the legend of the ten rings,"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.",19 September 2021
eltechshops, Fresh vibe for MCU but ...,"It was refreshing to see this new MCU movie. I thought it didn't feel like a typical MCU movie and I loved it for that.The Character of Shang Chi was a relatable well developed character and his relationship with Awkwafina was pleasently good and didn't feel forced in any way.She is mostly used as a comedic source in this movie but she had a nice balance where I didn't feel like she was too annoying like Marvel tends to make certain characters.Fighting choreography was unbelievable and I enjoyed it a lot. It certainly brought something fresh to the MCU .The villain was very memorable and had a nice little arch throught the movie.There are however certain flaws in this movie that didn't quite land with me.Ben Kingsley , even though an incredible actor was unecessery in this movie. He was used just as a comedic energy that never worked in my eyes. It was incredibly annoying and didn't bring any charm to this movie so some moments were ruined by the classical Marvel comedy.The movie overall felt like it was grounded and simplistic and I loved it for that , we don't need Avengers style in every single Marvel movie and that is exactly what this movie does in the third act.The thrid act in my opinion just forgets the whole buildup , the fighting choreography , the art of chinese martial arts and gets into full speed Marvel mode.You get this big Sci Fi battle with flying monsters , lightshow , flying people and everything that was kind of lowkey in the first two acts was turned into Red Bull energy drink in the third act. Why is every single hero fighting to save the whole world !? I think we need at least 200 more Avengers because the Marvel Earth is apperently unsafest planet in existence.One big question for me is , if Ten Rings is such a threat to our world and they have been doing bad things for years how come no one noticed that ? Did Avengers never hear about them ? Wong ?There are plenty of questions unanswered but I still enjoyed this movie. It felt like it gave respect to some older martial art movies and for some time it definitely had that special charm.If they had only kept it more simplistic and consistent throughout the whole movie , this one could have been much better.PlatinummanYT 7.4/10.",27 January 2022

ClapperProject, Sure it's refreshing but...,"I had some high expectations to this movie and I was really excited with the fact that this was the first Marvel movie with it's majority of the cast being Asian, which shouldn't be a surprise given the story context but unfortunately from the standards that American cinema have set in the past, it is, and even better, include some non-English dialogue to make things more authentic. I do hope they continue to make more diverse adaptions from comics since the world of entertainment will for sure thrive on this!The movie as some fantastic fighting sequences, high praise for the stunt team, the fighting scenes are indeed a delight to watch and at the beginning the story is engaging, with some fun cameos throughout.However as the story unfolds things start to take a different turn.The first thing that threw me off was the visual effects, I mean the fighting sequence on the bus was a very promising one, starting off great but then it just became weird and I had the exact same feeling when watching the Black Widow - how does a 100 plus million dollar movie has CGI this crappy? The standards I got used to from a Marvel perspective are way higher than the floppy CGI shown in a lot of the scenes, some worst than others yet I couldn't get pass that.Then the story and its pace... I mention this in most Marvel movies, I am of course aware these are purse fantasy, but with all the connection made between the super heroes now, it's impossible not to compare them since they are living in the ""same Universe"", for Shang-Chi the fantasy becomes obvious from start, which was fine, however things escalate, to the point where on the third act it seems I am no longer seeing a Marvel movie but rather a kid's adaption to a tale that takes place somewhere in ancient Asia.It's fun but it seems that I watched 2 different stories under the same movie and the pace is just too fast, all of the characters who led fairly normal lives (specially the supporting character) absorb all of this magical new world as if it was ""another regular day"".I didn't feel much engagement to the main character, although the storyline was somehow interesting there's a lack of charisma in most actors (with some exceptions from the villain and from the aunt without giving much spoilers).Once again I am all up that they continue to make diverse movies but this one didn't work for me.",14 November 2021

JWick23, A diverse new addition,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten rings is one of the marvel's first phase 4 movies. In hindsight it has a underlying tone and story similar to that of Black Panther. Both being representations of certain groups and and their cultures.The story is solid. It wasn't perfect as it had some minor flaws. A bit cheesy with good writing and comedy but nothing exceptional. The fight scenes , the choreography and dragons were cool which were refreshing compared to the last couple of MCU movies that were released. The characters are nothing to interesting other than Shang Chi and his dad and their whole dynamic.Overall an enjoyable film.

Carycomic, Best action-movie I've seen all summer!,"There are, of course, a lot of changes that had to be made between the comic book character and his Disney-fied counterpart. First and foremost being Shang-chi's paternal heritage! As Marvel no longer had licensing rights to the name ""Fu Manchu,"" the hero's villainous father had to be revised to being the true Mandarin (as opposed to Ben Kingsley's politically incorrect caricature as a terrorist group figurehead).Then, there's Shang-chi's sister. Instead of Fah Lo Suee (another literary character licensed to the Estate of Sax Rohmer), we have Xu Xialing. And, for Shang-Chi's girlfriend, we get American-born Katy. An original character who seems to be an amalgam of Leiko Wu and Misty Knight. Which only stands to reason, I suppose, as Shang-chi's maternal heritage seems to amalgamate his silver screen origin with the comic book origin of Iron Fist!Most important of all, however, is the emotional plausibility. Simu Liu provides that, for this version of Shang-Chi, the same way Tobey Maguire first brought believability to the cinematic Peter Parker.All in all? Not a bad way to transition from the end of summer into the next phase of Marvel Films.",7 September 2021

moviematthewh-60783," Standard repetitive storyline, but the concepts are creative and fresh","Right from the start I realised that the plot structure and storyline was very standard and repetitive. It's seen in many other action/superhero films. But as the action kicked in, I was still invested. It's a very fast paced movie with some new action sequences we haven't seen in the mcu yet, as well as some good comedic moments. The choreography for the action is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Very long cuts show all the action without quick cuts after every move someone takes. It's also a very beautiful film I thought in terms of scenery and colours. Music was also great, epic score and some killer songs. Definitely check out the soundtrack. But as the film entered its long third act, the ending was very underwhelming. We are being thrown at with so much stuff in a short period of time, so the reveals of some things and actions aren't as interesting as they should of been. But the film has opened up even more possibilities for what's to come in the mcu timeline, so make sure to stay for those credits scenes. But even someone who hasn't seen any or a few mcu films can watch this as it's a good standalone film. They may not understand a few things that characters talk about regarding previous events but I could assume that they'd still be invested. Overall, a solid entry for our new character Shang-Chi in the mcu, as well as having some awesome action, funny moments and eye popping miss en scene.",17 September 2021

datoneman, Amazing movie but to many slow/dry parts Katy is a life saver,"I actually enjoy the movie I didn't hate it or love it, it has a few to many slow parts for my personal like I was extremely hype to see it got there started off amazingly got to the beginning of the middle and the middle of the middle of the movie it was just to many dry/slow parts at that point for me lucky that's when they hit with the dragon eyes and the Mandarin saves at that point for me just enough to give me a little more energy to stay up I was dozing off lmao I actually love the layers of his father to me it seemed more of his story then his story and how the lost of his wife actually is the reason why he did what he did and to show no matter how much you battle you conquer destroy take over Love is All powerful and even the most powerful individuals are weak when it comes to love and can be easily manipulated when it comes to love I dislike the father at first until you see his reason behind it then you actually hurt for him because he wants his wife so bad to the point some things he refused to see because he wants his with that bad, and it actually outshine his son backstory the ending of the movie most definitely save the movie to me because it was action but not enough action to me it should have been a lot more action the movie seem to be slightly rush in some area the end credits mmm to be blunt the first end credit should have been last and the last end credit should have been first I love the empowerment of women it should have been done better they touched on their culture very well with the daughter and sons one not look at the same as the other and I love how they made effort to touch on the Urban culture as well with the music buuuuut a lil overkill for the most part I give it a 7 because it just takes you out around the middle a little to much the slow/dry parts was to much not enough action and I wouldn't pay my money again to go back and look at it again but I will buy it, when it comes out in 4k but only if it's on sale I couldn't get in to it like I wanted to I would say go out and see it very amazing movie.",6 September 2021

Jithindurden, What a pleasant surprise this was!,"Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months. Going in I expected marvel to half-ass the genre but still make it entertaining like a number of their other films. But I was taken aback wonderfully right from the beginning with the opening narration completely in Chinese. What I saw then was a proper modern wuxia fantasy which with some changes could've fooled me for a Chinese production (maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic).As fitting to a wuxia film, the lust for power, the love that conquers evil and the despair of lost love are all seen in this film. And who best to bring all those than the legendary Tony Leung who was the face of Hong Kong cinema through In The Mood For Love and acted in some of the best Wuxia films. He was definitely the best thing about the film. I was half expecting Marvel to mess it up like they use great actors for villains all the time. But he was the first main character to appear and even till the end his presence was felt.This also has some of the best hand to hand action sequences in the MCU easily. The martial arts action, even when the superpowers are included also makes the action just beautiful which is something I feel the first time in an MCU film.Awkwafina was quirky but what I liked there was that they kept it platonic and didn't jump into anything at any point. Maybe they'd do that in the future but at least they didn't break the flow in the relationship. Meng'er Zhang and Fala Chen also made their presence felt, as badass fighters. And Michelle Yeoh as expected of her came in and owned the screen when she was present.I'm really surprised at how much I liked the film. The final fight sequences that rose to the most epic Chinese fantasy fight you can think of is the only thing I was expecting them to not mess up. Maybe it is because of my low expectations on how Marvel deals with the genre and the villain that made me love this so much.",26 February 2022

Don't go into this expecting anything beyond those 14 words. You won't find it. Instead you'll find a hollow movie, with needless use of subtitled mandarin and not a single original concept anywhere.If this were a stand alone movie not trying to link itself in with a broader universe it would have had the freedom of better writing.Instead we get something that makes snakes on a plane look like an in-depth drama.

thatsgottahurt-1, It's VERY Disney,"A little Disney goes a long way, and much of this film is pure Disney. It's alright but not great. There's the usual Disney type story of love and loss. Good parent/bad parent and estranged siblings. There's the usual 'cutesy' banter between lead and sidekick and the (very) familiar dynamic between same. There's some very Pokémon looking animals and also some creatures that look like they came straight out of the World of Warcrafts bestiary. It's very samey and is obviously just a setup for future Marvel/Disney outings. My enthusiasm is staring to wane for this type of thing. Endgame seems so long ago, and it's doubtful if we'll ever see something so monumental from this company again.",12 October 2021
hoernkeem," Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021, Destin Daniel Cretton) MCU's new hero is vital yet his story feels derivative","'Black Widow' may have been the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to hit theaters following the recommencement of major films debuting in theaters after the COVID 19 pandemic numbers dropped, however, 'Shang-Chi' is the true start of the next wave of MCU development. All of the original characters, minus Thor, have been retired from service by death or other means so new blood is required via new superheroes and new origin stories, and given the current state of affairs look for a much more diverse flavor of super-hero going forward. 'Shang-Chi' marks the first step on that path with the first true Asian super-hero to hit the big screen starring Simu Liu in the title role who is originally from China although his parents immigrated to Canada when he was only five. The actors and characters here are almost entirely Asian lending credibility to the character and the plot. Co-stars include Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung.Thousands of years ago Xu Wenwu discovers these ten magical rings which he can wear to give him great power and immortality. He wields them through the centuries to collect power. In 1996 he journeys to the hidden entrance of a village known as Ta Lo to accumulate more power. He meets a woman, Ying Li, guarding the entrance and she is able to match him in a martial arts fight. He leaves but returns and eventually love sprouts between the two. For a time he sets aside the rings and power and starts a family resulting in two children but when Ying Li dies he reverts to his old ways and raises his kids under his authoritarian rule within his Ten Rings criminal organization. He raises son Shang-Chi to be a warrior, but Shang flees, leaving his sister, and starts a new life in San Francisco. There he exists as a normal guy with job as a car valet. He is kind of an underperforming slacker, but seems happy with where he is. His best friend is Katy played by Awkwafina. One day Shang-Chi is attacked on a bus and his medallion is stolen and he knows his father has found him. This launches him and Katy on a quest to find his sister and foil his father's nefarious plans before he destroys the mythical town where his mother is from by unleashing some kind of hellspawn demon into the world.While 'Shang-Chi' is raking in rave reviews my response is a bit more measured. I think this is a solid origin story and introduces a dynamic new character that could prove to be a vital part of this next phase of the MCU. I think Simu Liu is well cast as is Awkwafina as his best friend/sidekick, but I thought overall the film was better than average rather than the superlative, next level action hero blockbuster I was expecting. First I feel that the film is derivative in its plot a bit. Some of this comes from the fact that I just saw 'Raya and the Last Dragon' and this feels a lot like that movie. They both even feature Awkwafina and 'Shang-Chi' even has a dragon in final climactic battle sequence. I thought it was clever, but also clearly revisionist history to have Ben Kingsley's much maligned Trevor (aka The Mandarin), from 'Iron Man 3' make an appearance. That was clearly designed to undo the plot misstep that was utilizing The Mandarin and the Ten Rings in that film as a sham terrorist organization. I very much enjoyed all the martial arts action and the fights were very well filmed and choreographed. The actual ten rings of power that eventually get passed to Shang-Chi by the end felt like a bit of one trick pony. They were kind of cool and clearly powerful, but the artifact's power set remained a bit unclear and their use while visually stimulating seemed very cartoonish at times. I am not sure how to rectify the look of the ten rings when employed, but I was hoping for better on that front. I was also perplexed a bit by the clear takeover of the Ten Rings organization by Shang's sister at the film's close which seems designed to lead to a larger plot in a different film, but that move also is very reminiscent of what Sharon Carter is doing over in the Disney Plus MCU shows.Most of the time I found myself asking the larger MCU questions rather than enjoying this film. This came in the form of the appearance of Wong and Emil Blonsky (aka Abomination) in an underground fighting ring in Macau run by Shang-Chi's sister. Why are this two disparate MCU supporting characters there and also why do they appear to be in allegiance as one is a hero and the other a villain? The other MCU connections come in the post credit scenes where Wong pulls hastily minted super-heroes, and possibly new Avengers, Shang and Katy, into his Sanctum Santorum for a powwow with Captain Marvel and Bruce Banner regarding the ten rings artifact which are emitting a mysterious signal. The most important piece of all this would seem to be the glaring absence of Doctor Strange.There is a lot of good stuff to take away from 'Shang-Chi'. The film is full of some new and dynamic characters. Marvel needs these characters to catch fire if they are going to build this next phase of the MCU into something that can culminate in an 'Infinity War/Endgame' level event. This is a good story, even if a tad derivative, and it is filmed and executed well. It has some prototypical MCU style humor, mainly due to Awkwafina, but the humor is more low key than a lot of other MCU films. The well choreographed fight scenes are about the best thing here. They are fun and intense and really take me back to boyhood trying to absorb as many martial arts movies as I could. This is a solid entry, especially as an origin story, into the MCU. I liked the film and the character of Shang-Chi. It remains to be seen how he will be integrated, going forward, into the larger cinematic universe.Eric's Grade: B.",18 September 2021

Spectacular viewing from the MCU!Sean (Shang-Chi) lives in San Francisco and parks cars for a living with his best friend Katy, whom he met when they were 14. He's happy with his life.

sperkinz, The moral is that women shouldn't settle,"Shang-Chi and the legend of Sumi Liu is gorgeous is a totally fine Marvel movie, where, like every marvel movie, someone is upset that someone kinder than them dies and even though that person told them this isn't the way, the decided to fight and kill people for revenge. Then someone else teaches them that, just like the kinder person who they are upset about said, stop using anger to solve your problems.Apparently the moral is that women who are younger, more beautiful, smarter, more powerful, and kinder shouldn't settle. Even if their kids end up with the pretty genes, destruction will reign because their dad just isn't good enough, and clearly knows it.",8 September 2021

The acting and the cinematography is so beautiful. I like how much was in Chinese, it made it all so realistic. I'm happy Kate and Shang-Chi didn't end up together or anything, they are good best friends and there wasn't room for it. The fight scenes are one of the highlights of the movie. Wow.

BijeshNagesh, Mindblowing,"A brilliant blend of Chinese (Asian) culture and superhero storytelling infused ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" with a level of excellence and beauty, wonder and awe, that only such a film can capture.Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, this movie from Marvel was a lush planet of possibilities in their already gilded multi-verse. I enjoyed every second of this film, especially what each of its cast brought to it.Simu Liu as the titular Shang-Chi (alias Shaun) was outstanding in the lead role. He more than breathed life into this popular comic-book character. I truly appreciated the 'less is more' approach to his performance.Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery and Awkwafina as Katy were both scene-stealers. A powerhouse support-performance came from Michelle Yeoh - I've been a huge fan of hers - who played Ying Nan.Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as Xu Wenwu (the 'big bad') was remarkable. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing was superb. So was Fala Chen as Li and Florian Munteanu as Razor Fist. I also liked what Andy Le brought to his role as Death Dealer. Wong, played by Benedict Wong, made interesting cameos. The younger versions of Xialing and Shang-Chi - played by Elodie Fong and Jayden Zhang, respectively - were both good. Shang-Chi's teen version played by Arnold Sun was also good.Screenplay by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton, and Andrew Lanham left no loose ends. The Mandarin inclusions added realism to the film's characters. The writers took familiar and established Asian-movie storytelling techniques and gave it a Marvel-ian twist that I found enormously admirable.Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin were the original creators of this superb superhero, namely Shang-Chi, in Marvel canon. I'm sure they stand proud knowing what this movie has done to capture the spirit and resolve of their hero.Bill Pope's cinematography and Joel P. West's musical scoring were both significant drivers of credibility and entertainment for Disney+ Hotstar's ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"". They both did an excellent job.Art direction and production design, as well as set decoration and stunts, and VFX/special effects/animation/CGI all did mighty good work on this project. Not a single frame felt 'less than' or 'just enough'. The crew in these departments certainly went out of their way to instil a 'larger than life' sense with every choreograph and sequence in the movie.Costume design by Kym Barrett deserves special mention. She has done great work before on other notable titles. Her talents were more than perfect for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" on Disney+ Hotstar. She balanced Asian flavour with signature Marvel style, a task not altogether simple.There is more going on in this deeply meaningful and potently symbolic movie than meets the eye. Such glorious Kung-Fu scenes as well. Fans are sure to enjoy everything that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has to offer. Don't forget to watch that end-credits scene - it looks like we're getting a sequel. There's also a deleted scene available.To be honest, I have not read a single comic book featuring the titular hero, but I have heard of him. My first proper introduction to Shang-Chi was (technically) in this movie, and I must admit it drew me to appreciate and be inspired by the character on multiple levels.",16 November 2021
valen060, MCU's Phase Four Truly Begins,"For the latest flick in the MCU Shang-Chi, it's magnificently assembled with a stellar cast like 'Crazy Rich Asians' stars Awkwafina and Michelle Yeoh combined with an interesting performance of Tony Leung as Wenwu (aka the Mandarin). Simu Liu as the lead is a welcoming addition to the Marvel family with his martial arts skills and adds more to this ever-growing universe.The visuals, the fight choreography, and an interesting soundtrack to boot! It makes you think this is more like a martial arts fantasy film rather than a typical Marvel movie. The metaphorical Pandora's Box also plays a role in the film's plot as it has a moral about truth and consequence. I even took notice of the moral values and quirks usually seen in Asian families that it began to remind me of the most recent film Crazy Rich in a way in terms of valuing your heritage and roots, but learning that your past doesn't dictate what you should become many years later.At 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, Simu Liu spoke about what it's like to be part of Marvel. He was so humble to speak of it. After what I've seen in this movie, it makes sense on why he said at the panel of him citing Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman (respect) as an influence in taking on this lead role. Chadwick helped open that door for him, he took it, and made it his own for audiences who look like him.After all that's transpired in the MCU since 2008, I can't wait to see where else Shang-Chi will go next from here. I recommend it.",7 September 2021

It was funny, the action sequences were very amazing, the fight choreography was awesome, reminded me of Jackie Chan. CGI was amazing.I gotta say, after seeing the movie, Shang Chi is in my top 3 favorite Marvel Charachters, and the best MCU movie for me.ITS WORTH WATCHING. Don't listen to the negative reviews.

blott2319-1," Could be better, still enjoyable","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before.",15 September 2021

benm-41751," A fun, entertaining, visually stunning, and heartfelt repeat of the same tired formula","As far as superhero movies retreading the same ground over and over like a pizza slicer struggling to cut through a dull crust, particularly in the current climate of overdone and overrated Marvel movies, Shang-Chi stands on its own as a very fun and endearing film. It takes you on a rollercoaster from humble jokes between friends to fighting brutes on a bus to eventually the epic battle you expected. Compared to some Marvel movies which are now feeling to make care about who I'm supposed to be cheering for in the first place, Shang-Chi is a much more likeable and worthy movie.In carrying out this formula, I think the movie does it perfectly. And I came to like the characters enough to be invested and enchanted by the events. The Chinese flavour of the movie helps to give it more rhythm and depth, at least on the surface level.Still, at the end of the day, this is another overbudgeted blockbuster action movie which makes less sense the further along you watch. Given how tight the first half of the movie is, I did find myself taken out of it by the insertion of Trevor Slattery and the obligatory ""cute little critter that knows everything"" moment. And while the inevitable final battle was very well done and exhilarating, it still exchanged logic and gravity for another slog through a chaotic battlefield of good versus evil. I also wished that Shang-Chi's father would start to make sense by the end of the movie, because he seemed enigmatic and layered at the beginning but came across as a stereotypical tyrant dad by the end.So overall, I'd say this movie is definitely worth a watch (and worth the hype) in the sea of superhero movies. It leads the pack in that bunch, but doesn't stray from it - for better and worse.",14 September 2021

avinca-21770, The same but different,"When watching Shang- Chi you will almost immediately see that it follows the same formula as every other marvel movie, but there is one thing that this movie excels at and that is the choreography. The choreography is some of the best seen in the the marvel universe and maybe even in cinema in general. The character of Shang- chi (played by Simu Liu) is a great addition to the MCU, but I can not say the same for some of the other characters in the movie especially the character Katy.(played by Awkwafina). The character is very flat and childish making her almost annoying though I believe that this is the fault of the writers and not Awkwafina. Another aspect of this movie that I like is the cameos, while I will not mention them to avoid spoilers, I will say that they are definitely one of my favorite parts of not only this movie but of the MCU in general. All in all I give Shang-chi a 9 out of 10. Great movie.",9 September 2021

kane_nelson, Shang-Chi!,"Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) moved away from his father Wenwu and the ten rings organization (Tony Leung) 10-years ago to live a normal life, but when his father comes looking for him, he is forced to confront his past alongside his best friend Katy (Awkwafina) and sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang).I have to admit, I knew nothing about this character when this film was first announced. I was sceptical whether I would like it or not. It did not disappoint; this movie was really good. I have seen every marvel movie released, and this one felt so unique.The story was one I thoroughly enjoyed and was invested in, and this movie has some of the best choreographed fight scenes in recent history that complemented the storytelling very well. It was so good to look at. The two most insane instances were the bus scene which was incredibly done and my personal favourite of the movie, but also the scaffolding scene a close second. That's not to say there wasn't excessive use of CGI in certain aspects of this movie, especially towards the end of the film, but that was expected as it's what you can expect from marvel nowadays.Simu Liu is amazing in this movie, he nails all the fight scenes, but even some of the down to earth heartfelt scenes he was great. Awkwafina is also really good in this movie. I wasn't sure about her at first, from her opening scene, I felt like she was going to be an annoying character throughout, but she wasn't. She was hilarious and she has great chemistry with Simu. I loved Tony Leung's performance as the leader. He is up there for me as one of the best villains in any marvel movie. I wasn't sure how to feel with Ben Kingsley returning for this movie, but I admit I enjoyed his scenes in this.The Pacing was pretty good in the film, I can't think of a single moment that I felt didn't belong and I didn't enjoy watching. My only real flaw to this movie is the ending. The creatures near the end were pretty underwhelming in my opinion. They were hyped up to be menacing creatures, but just felt like overdone CGI to create some intense moments. Not to say it was not fun, just thought it could have been better used.This was an entertaining movie, and I would recommend it. 7/10.",17 January 2022
gastonregatense," Shang-Chi, Marvel's Black Horse","Shang-Chi is a movie that nobody expected. An exemplar with which we were not familiar that, not only knew how to exploit their low expectations to the maximum extent, but also developed a structured and dynamic narrative immersed in a MCU that does not leave much room for new heroes.Shang-Chi made its first appearance in Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin's ""Special Marvel Edition # 15"" (December 1973). A Kung-Fu master created in the middle of the genre's boom in the US in the 1970s, Shang-Chi is quite a quirky character.Played by Simu Liu, the protagonist is embarked on an adventure after being intercepted by ghosts from his past. Full of action, martial arts and a very own and attractive aesthetic, the film unfolds without delay. The scenes are punctual and always add something new. Even with a sense of humor that can get heavy on certain occasions (such as when Katy makes jokes in the middle of life and death situations), Shang-Chi finds its essence, exploits it and ends with a gold ribbon leaving the door open for future aftermath.Marvel and its production team never cease to amaze me with their new films. In a difficult transition period, given the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the beginning of this new phase, the studio keeps its feet on the ground and continues a coherent thread of its interconnected universe. Regardless of the obvious mentions to the events of ""Avengers Endgame"", Marvel returns to do what it does best: including thousands of references, cameos and winks that leave the geeks like me open-mouthed and with the greed for more.The cast is incredible. I did not know any of the actors beforehand and they all dazzled me with their distinctive personalities and professional interpretations. The studio made a great work in synthetizing the oriental culture´s mythology and beliefs. However, it is true that Shang-Chi continues to be a westernized vision of Asian cultures due to its falls into stereotypes of martial arts and frequent characterizations of the Eastern world in Hollywood. Despite this and to my surprise, Shang-Chi knows how to combine the best of both worlds, using humor as its best tool and taking its time to tell the story, avoiding the rush to get to the action sequences that movies of this kind have suffered
The protagonist's arc is round and fulfilling. It has cohesion and is true to its ideals from beginning to end. Thus, the villain (excellently played by Tony Leung) only contributes to the plot and does not fall into the corner of un-memorable Marvel villains. We send you a greeting, Fake Mandarin. If it hadn't been for the blessing acting skills of RDJ, no one would remember your existence.Furthermore, the film interprets the concept of ""grays"" very well. In a franchise that is ""infantilized"" at times, Shang-Chi does not stutter in telling the hard truths of reality such as unsatisfactory employment, unreal family expectations, childhood trauma, the dilemma about murder, among others. Heroes are not pure white. They have their shortcomings, they fight with their demons and that makes them more credible, more human.With a stellar sound-track, Shang-Chi is one of Marvel's most unexpected gems. It is amazing to feel and denote the love with which these films are made and the fidelity to the source materials. For example, the main character's leitmotif is a work of art and a composition that immerses us even more in the plot. Kevin Feige deserves all the praise, he is truly a man who knows how to sell his product very well and, at the same time, sell us something with great qualitative value.After the post-credits scenes, fans only crave more and rejoice in the near future for what remains of this phase. Now with the recent release of the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, one only has to cross out the days for its premiere and admire the attention to detail that they put into the making of the films, not only as individual creations, but as a large adjoining and a special set of films. Bravo Marvel.Postscript: I really love Benedict Wong. Is he the ultimate man?",7 September 2021
Special-K88, Marvel continues to be ambitious despite some faults,"Eluding his difficult past, a young man from China has been content playing it safe in San Francisco for the past several years even though he lacks a true sense of self. But when drastic circumstances draw him back to his conspicuous origins, he has no choice but to face his demons head on. Continuing to expand its cultural horizon the MCU's first Asian-centric movie has unique choreography, a dazzling visual scheme, splendid hand-to-hand combat, and of course the expected teases going forward, but some of the more elaborate action set pieces lack needed tension, much of the exposition and backstory isn't very engaging, and up until the third act many of the emotional aspects of the narrative aren't as rich or compelling as they could be. Some of the humor is strained, but it's efficiently cast and provides enough to be a distinctive entry into the Marvel world. **½",25 September 2021
alexandertelfer, Seriously Poor,"I have just arrived home from the cinema. Whilst I have seen the majority of the MCU movies many times, I hope I never see this one again. It's beyond me how some people can give this high ratings. There were some good actions scenes which generated the 2 stars but that's as far as it goes. I like Ben Kingsley, but what was his character doing in the movie? - it was completely out of place and had a ridiculous story line as to why he was there. However it did add the funniest part to the movie where he thought the apes in the original Planet of the Apes films were actually apes. My wife, who is a big MCU fan, also thought it was poor. My 11 year old son thought it was OK because he was proud of himself for recognising Wong & Abomination. I am going to cheer myself up now by watching ' The Face of Fu Manchu' - that's go a proper villain in it.",11 September 2021

minerwolfminer, Coronavirus!,"Oh my gosh! Where do I even start? First, high expectations for this movie but it sadly, did not live up to those expectations...There is a lot to talk about. I don't want to be too harsh on this movie because it was made during the Coronavirus time. The quality of movies have decreased ever since.The movie begins by introducing us to the father of Shang-Chi; also know as the man who never becomes old thanks to the powerful ten rings. We get a story of how he meets his airbending wife and Shang-Chi gets born to see his now powerless mother get 1v20 by a bunch of dudes then dies. This new hero's story is pretty similar to Robin from the Teen Titans. He trains so hard and becomes an absolute assassin or master martial artist. Right? Let's disregard everything else about this movie and talk about who would win in a 1v1. Nightwing vs Shang-Chi. Place your bets guys. I'm voting for Nightwing.This movie has awesome fight scenes but I also have a problem with those scenes. They look too easy! Don't get me wrong, I cannot do those sick flips and spins. What I mean is, the enemies are too weak. I expected deadlier and more skilled ninjas. I also feel bad for that buff dude! C'mon! They made him seem so weak! That's the freaking guy from Creed 2. I even thought it was Scott Adkins at first. Another concern for this movie is this CGI. It looked great at first, but started falling off during the ending which relied on heavy visual effects. Story felt bland and had so much back stories and it was confusing. Last bad thing is the romance. Shang-Chi and this girl from Ocean's Eight have 0 CHEMISTRY! They were perfect as friends! Ugh! I'm sorry but this did not feel like a Marvel movie. Disappointed but I shouldn't blame them. It's the fault of Coronavirus. That's why it still gets a 6.",16 November 2021
jcsallows, Welcome to the Marvel Family...again...,"I'm not going to downplay this movie for it's action, visuals and comedy (but not as much comedy as you'd expect from a Marvel movie). If you just want an entertaining movie, I think the MCU has figured that much out at this point. Oddly enough, Awkwafina is the best part of this movie. I like her better in this than other things I've seen her in.The main character, Shang-Chi, really sells this movie. Simu Liu knocks it out of the park with his perfomance. He knows how to play an everyman. His chemistry with Awkwafina works well and are the best scenes in the movie. I thought it was interesting that, like many other marvel characters, he's a superhero who could be a regular guy walking down the street. You wouldn't know unless you knew his backstory (and believed it). I also liked the whole transition where he faces his true identity in finally confronting his father (the main antogonist).So the weakpoints, it's just as you'd expect. The villain is about as 2-dimensional as it gets. I didn't really care for him even as the credits rolled. The fact that he was Shang-Chi's father is literally the only thing making him relevant to the story or remotely interesting. Even the whole Ten Rings super power didn't completely sell me. It looked cool but beyond that, it was a guy with metal rings on his arms...which makes him...the most powerful man in world history? Sure, whatever.The other (and I would say biggest) weakpoint is the story. Like I began this review, this has great visuals, action and is a generally entertaining movie. BUT...I can't help but think there are Marvel screenwriters who are copy/pasting stories from previous Marvel movies. The third act was borderline ripped from Black Panther. It's a shame because I think this movie, in a vacuum, is really something special without elements feeling regurgitated from the MCU's back catalogue.Look, I get it. Sometimes you want the same thing. I'm not going to stop you from watching Marvel, Pixar and Disney cartoon movies (or their live-action remakes). But I personally have never heard of Shang-Chi from the comics, barely knew of most of these actors and just feel less invested than I was pre-Avengers: Endgame. It feels odd waiting for X-Men, Deadpool, Wolverine, Iron Fist, Fantastic 4, Blade, New Avengers and others to join the MCU but we're watching this while we wait. Do we need this many MCU movies? I guess that's not for me to decide.",19 September 2021
ashhrawlins, Some of the best animation I've ever seen,"So personally I'm not huge into the marvel scene so my score came as a surprise to me.

p-jonsson, Surprisingly good.,"I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke ""critics"" on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.The movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.It begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.This movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.There are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.The story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.Overall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn't fall in the trap of trying to ""educate"" said audience.",16 January 2022

WyttBobee, Amazing New MCU Hero,"Let me just say I didn't know what to expect going into this movie, but I'm glad I bought the tickets. The story was amazing and the fighting scenes were really good choreographed and just overall top tier camerawork, the actor who played him is amazing and the movie was amazingly funny definitely worth watching.",7 September 2021
wifeymoof, Stunning!!!,"I was super excited to see this movie and boy, it doesn't disapoint!! Visually, it's incredible. I really enjoyed the comedy factor. Ben Kingsley is always a joy to watch!! I'm a huge MCU fan and this movie is in my top 5 to watch for sure. I cant wait for further installments. Acting is impeccable by all involved! Well done Marvel!",13 November 2021
ilanghitelman, Here we go Marvel,"Very genuine film, I guess all we were waiting for a new avenger in the crew. The combats and images of this film are amazing. The main character has all the qualities to become a good element in the avengers team.",10 September 2021
zac-04879, Exciting; Possibly One of Marvel's Greatest Films,"Marvel has supplied their fans with a fast, fresh and funny superhero adventure with unconditionally perfect amounts of exhilarating action and fascinating characters. The enthusiasm noticeably kicks off with sustainable writing, in which an appealing plot is arranged and the excellent protagonists are propped. Secondly, director Destin Daniel Cretton recieves the role of brilliantly executing the visually-awakening tale.There's no doubt that the real magic belongs to the epic sequences of fantastical action. With stylish martial arts battles and superb effects, Shang-Chi's epic movie lives up to both the hype and its genre. However, there are some ridiculous and unnecessary details. It's also significant to announce the fact that the amount of action is perfect! There's not too much to the point where it's tedious and not too less to the point where all that can be remembered is the dialogue.Marvel flicks usually include several moments of bland dialogue between the superheroes. It occasionally grows fairly unexciting, but most of it is surprisingly gripping and the entertaining adventure rules over it. Alongside the massively-praised action is humour and heart-pumping credits scenes.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",1 October 2021
portaguee, Absolutely Amazing!,"I can't express to you how amazingly beautiful this movie is. You need to watch it for yourself! Excellently choreography, awesome blend of humor, drama and action. I was beginning to think there was no place for martial artists in marvel after iron fist, I was proved wrong. Hopefully we get several more 👍👍",5 September 2021
alicemarshmallow, Great film.,"I really enjoyed the soundtrack, I thought it was a beautiful mix of modern and traditional music. The film itself was very well done, the CGI and animation was great as well as the acting. The story line and origin story was very though out and was very interesting.",19 January 2022
lohoy-96789, good,".. Suddenly, unexpectedly, and before us is one of the best creations of Marvel in its entire modern history, lasting already 14 years! A colorful, interesting, tasty, emotional, spectacular and bright spectacle should not leave anyone indifferent with a 'plus' sign, even though this character is not named..... By 2021, the 'Marvel' projects have reached such grandeur and scale that local producers can afford to experiment with certain characters unknown to the mass audience, but probably known to ardent fans of this huge comic book universe. 'The Eternals', 'Shan-Chi'... How many more new movie characters and new surprises are waiting for us?! Of course, it is difficult to say, however, given the frank failure of the first and the success of the second, everything is not so simple here! We will dwell on the second in more detail (for obvious reasons)!! ..This film, which is more than 2 hours long, tells us about such magical accessories as 10 rings, which give their owner unknown power, strength and immortality. At the same time, family joy/tragedy/joy is unfolding before us with numerous rather big flashbacks to the past, where the same 10 rings play a central role, without which, as judging from the title of the tape and its viewing, we will not get anywhere! As it turned out, we are in for a bit of fantasy and mysticism, a couple of familiar characters from previous 'Marvel' projects, a certain secluded area like Wakanda (only now with an Asian tint), as well as a colorful spectacle and, in principle, a very, very high-quality film ...",19 January 2022
janelle-14599, 10/10 THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE TO DATE!,"I was so excited for this movie and I was not disappointed. It had cgi, an amazing cast, a great soundtrack, setting etc. I have nothing bad to say about this movie. Other than that I dislike some of the bad guys, but that's what makes them bad guys so...
I was so shocked when I saw the end credit scene with Hulk and Captain Marvel and Wong. I love Shang-Chi and Katy's friendship and I just think that this movie is awesome. Also the martial arts and the stunts were awesome, especially the train scene and the fight in the Macao. So I'm just ending this to say that I love this movie and it's my new favourite marvel movie!!",3 September 2021
jesternz, Far fetched nonsense,Bizarre character selection. The cast didn't gel at any time. Weak attempts to link in previous Marvel characters... presumably because they need some work over the covid years. The story was far fetched nonsense. Marvel started with some good credible characters but continues its decline with this abomination.,18 December 2021
nickdambrosio77, Exceeds expectations!,"I did not have high expectations for this movie. Like many, I wasn't familiar with this hero going in.That being said, the choreography in action scenes was PHENOMENAL. Definitely the highlight of the film for me.If you're a fan of film, you will enjoy this beautiful movie.",6 September 2021
Spartan_1_1_7, Best thing in the MCU Phase 4 so far. At least you don't leave it full of disappointment that gets worse the more you think about it.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the first entry in MCU Phase 4 with a completely new superhero, an origin story, and is about Shang-Chi, son of a powerful man who has control of the ten rings as well as having an organization of the same name. Living a normal life, his world is turned upside down when the past he has left behind comes back to bite him. Not gonna lie, I wasn't hoping much from this movie considering how disappointing Phase 4 has been but to my surprise, this turned out to be the most entertaining entry in this Post-Infinity Saga so far, particularly because I didn't leave it filled with a layer of disappointment that gets worse the more you think about it.It's not groundbreaking or different from what the MCU has given us before, especially when it comes to origin stories. In fact, it feels very reminiscent of the earlier movies that came in this cinematic universe following a lot of the same formula, part of the reason I enjoyed it as it reminded me of the good ole days where I was genuinely hyped about the MCU and getting introduced to all these superheroes without having any solid comic-book reading history. It's the usual Marvel schtick with a different skin but with good enough execution in certain parts that you get a steady flow of entertainment and hardly any major frustrations, if at all, from the entire 130 mins runtime.What I enjoyed the most was the action sequences, which were predominantly hand-to-hand combat and weaponry based kung-fu. With good choreography and cinematography, fewer cuts, non-shaky cam, and the actors performing a lot of the combat themselves, it was thrilling. The accompanying soundtrack was nice too with a mix of modern and East Asian tracks that flowed well with the action.The story itself, while ending up with the usual end-of-the-world trope that so many superhero flicks have, wasn't bad either. It was cool to see this side of the world in this cinematic universe and not having a typical Human baddie was nice as well.However, the writing was still not particularly good as the movie sorely lacked urgency and stakes. There wasn't that OOOMPH that would have propelled this movie to higher tiers. It played safe and light with a lot of predictable elements so you just sorta experience the events which play out mostly how you'd expect. The dialogue could have been a lot better as well with the same story beats the movie employs and would have given characters a lot more depth where the emotional moments could have been hard-hitting. The titular character himself felt lacking in energy and charisma.I did like the overall ensemble and how it all came together in the end even if full of cliches. I was worried about Awkwafina's character Katie and that she'll be annoying for the rest of the movie but I was pleasantly surprised by her relationship with Shang-Chi played by Simu Lu, it was sweet. I'm glad the humour wasn't in your face throughout and took a backseat at certain points as MCU lately has developed a habit of injecting way too much of their brand of humour and it hasn't worked for me. Not saying the comedy here was great as some of it fell flat on its face but some of it did work.All in all, despite its problems, despite the movie playing it safe, despite it being predictable, I had fun. I do hope Simu Lu gives a stronger performance wherever his character shows up next because compared to other MCU heroes, Shang-Chi himself is among the lower end for me for now. If you like the MCU, then certainly give this a go. If nothing else, you'll probably enjoy the action. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 6.8/10.",19 November 2021
StoryTaker1, Great Marvel-movie with Bad-Narnia movie second half.,"I must say I am disappointed since I had quite high expectations from this movie - or at least didn't expect it to be bad after such a promising first half. Unfortunately, the second half was just that. The surprise gift of a gem in the movie however, for me, is being introduced to Tony Leung. I wished at several points in the movie that he were playing Shang-Chi. 3.5 out of my 5 stars is for him.The movie began well even if the first Ta-Lo fight was a little cheesy and a bit too wire-fu. Tony Leung brings such humanity to the character, conveying so much with his eyes with no expressions or mannerisms needed. A fascinating character shrouded in mystery and danger, but with a softness and vulnerability in his eyes.The rest of the first half was usual Marvel magic. The acting of Shang-Chi and Katy was a little bland, but passable. I liked the humour and also the continuity of the post-blip references. Shang-Chi finally got interesting in the bus scene - unfortunately he goes back to being a personality-less, second fiddle to Katy for the rest of the movie. How sad this should happen in his own movie? And as if to add insult to injury, the movie ends by saying ""The Ten Rings will return"" instead of Shang-Chi.As mentioned in the title, the second half felt like a bad Narnia movie. Everything predictable and a cliche. Someone says their people have been training to protect xyz for thousands of years - turns out, after all this time, they still fight with sticks and stones and have a pitiably small 'army'. Said army also turns out helpless at protecting xyz and needs the protagonist to save the day after he becomes an expert at what these people trained their whole lives, in about 15 minutes. Largely useless friend also saves the day when the experts can't.How is it that these people have a skill that can defeat Wenwu, a thousands year old martial arts master with the Ten Rings, but their army is so helpless against his goons and their technology? If this special skill was specifically to protect xyz, how come none of them used it in the battle? Instead it seems it was developed specifically to defeat the Ten Rings which they have no reason to know anything about. What on earth was the point of Ben Kingsley in this movie? I wish they spent that screen-time further exploring Shang-Chi, his personality, relationships etc.That brings me to my biggest grievance with the movie. A superhero movie should inspire - especially the origin story. It's when a character has that moment of clarity when they decide they won't let their weaknesses, or even mistakes, define them but will instead channel it all to fight for something good. Shang-Chi's moment could have been even more poignant considering he made quite a big mistake. However I feel the movie skirted around that, saying rather than showing because they didn't want to go there. Thus Shang-Chi's moment of clarity was deciding to kill his own father. Sure, he eventually doesn't during the big CGI battle - but why? Was he tired? He felt he couldn't go through with it? His mother's ghost told him not to? Who knows...I hope the next installment will be better. Maybe Shang-Chi will have a personality that can keep up with Katy.",19 November 2021
Neptune165, Shang-Chi's father is probably one of the best Marvel villains,"Love everything about this movie! Good origin story, great cast and awesome action scenes. Simu, Meng'er, Awkwafina, and Tony definitely nailed the role. I recently watched the movie and it was so awesome, I liked this one a lot more than the Black Widow one, and I can see why people got so hyped for this movie, and so far I think it has been phenomenal, of course I can't judge the new and upcoming spider man movie, cause We haven't seen it yet, but this film is just raising the bar so high to the point where other films are having a massive disadvantage to such standard story telling. I was blown away after watching it. The story, the fights, the casting, everything was just Marvellous!",15 January 2022

varun-25071997, This Theme Park Ride Entertains All Demographics,"It was hard to believe that Destin Daniel Cretton directed this film, which is a complete contrast from his previous work. Tony Leung Chiu Wai was the only reason to watch this movie if you aren't a sucker for superhero movies. Shang Chi proves Scorcese's point on Marvel movies despite being surprisingly entertaining.It was good to see a major blockbuster from a non-USA centric point of view. Shang Chi's best movements are it's timed humour and martial arts fight scenes. The ending of the movie is a theme park ride with eye soaring VFX of two dragons which are supposedy fighting but we don't know it due to excess use of colour.On the whole Shang Chi is a typical summer blockbuster which is bound to entertain all demographics but it's linear storyline and under utilisation of Tony Leung Chiu Wai's talent is a bit underwhelming.",5 September 2021
danielmanson, Unique. But a very fun film,"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!just an add on for this point. I will say there was a couple of points where it was quite obvious what was going to happen (ie when sister pops up for first time, you know exactly how about 10 mins before it happens). I think the final battle scene went on a bit longer than it needed to. But these are minor points that don't distract you or take anything away from the film itself.I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend.",14 September 2021

kbocaw, Disappointed Marvel Fan,"I am a huge marvel fan. My kids young and old are all huge marvel/super hero fans. I have seen every marvel movie multiple times, and just finished binge watching all of them in chronological order again recently. This movie started out a little funny and felt like it was going to be a good action flick once the fight scene started in the bus, despite some iffy cgi and the guy with the machete hand. It didnt take too long to realize that was one of the few good scenes in the movie. Dont get me wrong the fight scenes are done nicely, but they seem to drawn out to long. It all just fell flat. This is the first marvel movie that I didnt make it to see in theaters.... I even made it to black widow. Im glad I didnt make it for this one. I was beyond bored with the drawn out fight scenes, some of which werent needed, and lack of engaging dialogue. I never once felt connected or invested in any one character. I ended up turning it turned if off a little more than half way through. I have never done that with a marvel movie, even if ive seen it a dozen times before. I may try again sometime but doubt it.",10 November 2021
lumieretrain, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings by Destin Daniel Cretton,"The stories which follow warriors who have to confront a hard past, filled with pain and remorse, are intriguing to see how the main characters are getting self confident on both physically and psychologically. As the main characters through their body language they express on the way they are feeling emotionally, especially during the fight sequences, which initially their body language might be insecure to immediately lose their fight; but after the main characters have learnt in what they are looking for, their body language becomes more self confident and especially stronger, to even be ready to face their final battles to be often much intense than the first ones. The filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton seems interested to explore this theme, by developing a new movie for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this time about the character Shang-Chi. After a long time of work, in 2021 came out Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings by Destin Daniel Cretton, with Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Tony Leung, Fala Chen and Michelle Yeoh. The movie's plot: The martial artist Shaun/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), who in once has been trained to be an assassin, has left his past on the back to live in his own life in San Francisco; until his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), who is in the command of the Ten Rings organization, has reunited him and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) to search something essential in the village Ta Lo, where Ying Li (Fala Chen) the mother of Shang-Chi and Xialing guarded in once. The movie has captured a lot of attention, by surprising the audience, the critics and the fans of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, as the story went in a different direction than what the previous movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have gone, even the movie has maintained some of the established superhero elements in the cinematic universe. Especially for the way the movie explores the Asian culture, by using the Chinese mythological creatures, to let the audience feel emerged in another culture, through the settings and the colors to be expressive on the emotions of the story and on the feeling of the characters. The story gets much expressive in the emotions of the characters, through the choreography in the fight sequences, where their movements and their steps represent the way of how they will confront their greatest battles, both internally and externally. The production designer Sue Chan has elaborated the settings with specific details, to be expressive through the mythological look to the let the eyes of the audience be emerged in the story; at the same time, some of the most specific settings are filled with colors, which make them much powerful of the emotions and of the meanings on some of the most crucial moments of the story. The costume designer Kum Barrett has created costumes which fit with the shape and the colors of the characters, as most of them have been specifically elaborated to fit in their movements during the fight sequences; especially when the costumes fit with the body language of the characters, which can be felt without distorting their movements. The cinematographer William Pope has captured in every single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots, with the help of the lightnings, the shadows and the colors, some of the most essential shots of the scenes, which make some of the most essential moments of the story unforgettably poetic and mythological. The editors Elísabet Ronaldsdóttis, Nat Sanders and Harry Yoon have created the narration's rhythm in a clear way on how the story will be told from the beginning to the end, without distorting the narration of the story and by using essential footage which create the movie. The visual effects have been specifically elaborated to create some of the most spectacular scenarios of the story, in every single details of pixels to let the eyes of the audience be emerged in the story; especially through the settings, colors, lightnings and shadows, which make them mythologically spectacular. The score by Joel P. West has been elaborated to be more close to the Asian culture, in every single musical notes to balance the emotions of the characters; as well as some of the most essential moments of the story, to blend with the scenes without distorting the narration's rhythm nor in some of the most epic moments of the movie. Simu Liu did an excellent performance as Shaun/Shang-Chi, a martial artist who was in once trained as an assassin, to later on get away from the dramatic past to live in his own life; until his father Xu Wenwu has reunited him and his sister, where Shang-Chi has to confront his past to slowly become much confident with himself. Awkwafina did an excellent performance as Katy, the best friend of Shang-Chi who has no idea about his past, until she will come with him and learns more about him; initially she shows herself to be insecure and goofy, but since she has been involved with the mission of Shang-Chi she will become stronger internally as well as physically. Meng'er Zhang did an excellent performance as Xialing, the sister of Shang-Chi and the daughter of Xu Wenwu, who shows herself to be a strong person on the outside, but on the inside she is much vulnerable, especially because of the past which has tormented her; until she will become much confident, to be even closer to Shang-Chi and she will be the one who will later on change something important, in a crucial moment of the story. Tony Leung did an extraordinary performance as Xu Wenwu, the leader of the Ten Rings organization and the father of Shang-Chi and Xialing, who tries to be a good father for how much the love he has on them both; but since something tragic has happened, he has returned of what he used to be in once, especially to search in what he is looking for. Fala Chen did an extraordinary performance as Ying Li, the wife of Xu Wenwu and mother of Shang-Chi and Xialing, who will be seen often times in the flashbacks for an important reason; she has been the reason to have a family with Xu Wenwu, as in the flashbacks Ying Li has taught some of the most essential lessons to Shang-Chi. Michelle Yeoh did an excellent performance as Ying Nan, the guardian of Ta Lo and the aunt of Shang-Chi and Xialing, who will be the one to explain what is Xu Wenwu looking for and she will be also the one to teach Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy, with the help of the rest of the village, how to become much confident with themselves. Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings is an unexpectedly surprising movie, which uses some different elements from the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, it is one of the best movies of the cinematic universe as well as one of the best movies of 2021.",20 October 2021
dmansel, Another feather in the cap of Marvel Studios,"In 2018, the Marvel Cinematic Universe opened its doors to telling stories centered on people of color, providing the audiences with the rich, lush history of Wakanda and the Wakandan peoples. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a cultural revolution, but the impact Black Panther had on the moviegoing audience is undeniable. Since then, the MCU has released two female centered films in Captain Marvel and Black Widow and now we've arrived at Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, the first superhero movie to focus on characters of Chinese heritage. With this unveiling of a new corner of the connected universe comes new threats, new wonders, and new heroes to root for. Shang-Chi, originally appearing in Marvel Comics' Master of Kung Fu in the 1970s, now has an updated origin story for the modern times and a cast to reflect contemporary sensibilities.Opening with a fight scene that has an almost dream-like, ethereal storybook quality, the movie is packed with tons of action, heart, and humor. The father and son theme that is always so prevalent in the MCU is once again on full display here, this time coupled with a theme of legacies and living up to one's potential. Both Shang-Chi and his friend Katy are at peace with their low key lives as valets while both have parental figures who want more from them. In Shang-Chi's case, his father Wenwu wants him to eventually take his side as master of the Ten Rings, a multinational crime syndicate (a Rainbow Coalition of crime). That, paired with Wenwu's notion that this departed wife, Shang-Chi's mother, is still alive and being held captive in a mystical city, are the heart of the film, complete with great worldbuilding, awesome fight scenes, and amazing visuals.With Black Widow and now Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Phase Four of the MCU continues with the relative low stakes that comes after the insurmountable high of Avengers: Endgame. In Shang-Chi, a single village is at peril as Wenwu will stop at nothing to save his wife. Accompanying Wenwu are the ten rings, ten mystical arm bands that imbue the wearer with superhuman abilities. If you're one for explanations, you won't find any here as the rings are never fully explored beyond looking cool and being used to kick ass. One of the positives of the film is the fact that questions are left to be answered in the inevtiable sequel. Speaking of sequels, both end credits set up to help fully integrate the characters into the wider scope of the MCU while also serving as a platform for a continuation of Shang-Chi and sister Xialing's personal stories.While thoroughly entertaining, the film isn't without faults. As is the seemingly the norm for superhero movies, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' third act devolves into a CGI fest that at times is hard to follow visually. Without risking spoilers, the final battle, a mixture of natural and mystical elements, is choppy and confusing. It doesn't quite reach the levels of Wonder Woman bad, but there was potential for a more emotionally satisfying climax that was somewhat glossed over in favor of what we got. Also, from a comics perspective, the choice to include a location that draws heavy parallels to Kun-Lun (mystical city; multiple characters dressed in green and yellow, traditional Iron Fist colors; talk of the heart of a dragon) yet not outright include Iron Fist lore is a baffling one.Starring Simu Liu, Shang-Chi and the Legends of the Ten Rings put the Chinese actor first and foremost, giving Liu the opportunity to display his talents. As a member of the ensemble cast of sitcom Kim's Convenience, Liu shares the screen with a number of actors and actresses, but here as the leading man he's given the spotlight to shine. Liu's easygoing charm and affable nature will quickly win over audiences and endear them to the character. Liu's dramatic chops are on display as well as Shang-Chi spends the film clashing with both his sister and his father's way of life. Liu's Shang-Chi is here to stay in the MCU and after seeing his performance in his first outing, Marvel Studios has proven yet again one of their biggest talents lies in their ability to cast the right person for the right role. As such, Hong Kong born actor Tony Leung's first major introduction to western audiences as Wenwu finally gives Americans a chance to see one of the best living actors on display. Liu's style of quiet, pensive, deliberately nuanced acting isn't a major focus in Shang-Chi; the character of Wenwu is just a few steps above a Phase One villain. Similarly, Ray Winstone's Dreykov in Black Widow (while severely less developed than Wenwu), also has the feel of a Phase One villain which feeds into the idea of the MCU wiping the slate clean and resetting expectations back to their beginnings. Still, Leung is a joy to watch whenever he's on screen and his chemistry when paired with Liu makes for strong material.Awkwafina as Katy continues her trend of seemingly being Awkwafina in every role she's cast in. From Ocean's Eight to Crazy Rich Asians to Shang-Chi, her ebullient line delivery and acting style is at this point either well-worn or a comfortable blanket, depending on the penchant of the viewer. Katy's chemistry with Shang-Chi is undeniable, however, as the pair make for possibly the best on screen cinematic coupling since Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter. The brilliance of this pairing lies not in a good romantic subplot, but two incredibly close friends, ready to help each other out in any circumstance. If Jimmy Woo and Darcy are our Mulder and Scully of the MCU, Shang-Chi and Katy are Harry and Heromoine, ready for wacky adventures at a moment's notice while being comfortable with the nature of their relationship. One of the standouts of the film is Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's estranged sister. Zhang manages to command the screen with something akin to pent up rage and frustration as Xialing is determined to make her own legacy in the world. Zhang's growth and progression as a friend-or-foe foil for Shang-Chi is a delight to watch thanks to strong writing for the character and strong acting from Zhang.Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, Shang-Chi is a busy movie. Audiences are introduced to not just a new hero in the MCU, but an entirely new world, something not seen since 2018. Intercutting between events of past and present, this is the first of the Marvel films to rely heavily on flashbacks to establish relationships between characters. The non linear storytelling works thanks largely in part to certain reveals that awards previously withheld information from the audience. Unfortunately, while trying to keep the storytelling fresh by bouncing from past to present, the second act still feels sluggish due to heavy expositions from Wenwu and Jian Nan. Both carry a hefty bit of dialogue as they explain to Shang-Chi (and us) what's happened before in order to lay seeds of what's to come in the third act. The third act and the pathway to the inevitable confrontation between Shang-Chi and Wenwu still manages to surprise and subvert the common martial arts expectations in a way that feel somewhat satisfying, if not a bit surprising. Cinematographer Bill Pope (The Matrix trilogy, Scott Pilgrim vs the World) continues to dazzle with brilliant shots that, combined with great production design, manage to capture and celebrate the Chinese culture in a way that doesn't feel cliché or lazy. Cretton and Pope manage to pay homage to a number of films via the cinematography that includes both Kill Bill volume 1 and Skyfall.Of all the questions surrounding Shang-Chi prior to its release, going all the way back to its 2019 San Diego ComiCon announcement, the biggest area of concern was centered on the authenticity of the fight scenes. Fans of previous Marvel-related works (looking directly at you, Iron Fist) have been burnt in the past when it comes to well staged fight choreography. Thankfully that's not the case here, as the fight scenes are well crafted and tailored to fit the needs of each scene. Multiple styles of fighting are present, from the graceful, flowing wushu style as seen employed by Shang-Chi's mother and aunt to the more frantic, kinetic Jackie Chan-inspired style of improvised fighting Shang-Chi uses during the bus scene. Each style is well suited for the situation at hand and goes a long way to establishing the fact that there as many different styles of hand-to-hand combat as there are different Asian cultures. At no point do the fights seem lazy or unrehearsed; if there's one thing stunt coordinator Brad Allan was keen to do, it was to not repeat the mistakes of previous ventures into the genre.Overall, Shang-Chi is another feather in the cap of Marvel Studios. Finally embracing a multicultural aspect to their storytelling and recognizing that superheroes come from more places than just America, they've allowed themselves to fully open to a world of possibilities where stories steeped in any heritage can originate. A great leading performance from Simu Liu, a solid core cast, and a strongly directed film make Shang-Chi a worthy addition to Phase Four of the MCU. How it connects to the overall tapestry woven into the interconnected universe still remains to be seen, but with two stellar end credits sequences, hopes are high that our titular hero will return for more adventures with Katy in tow. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is in theaters September 3rd.",23 January 2022
mrcrazy-80641, Review,This movie have a different and best action of all marvel movies....25.......it is very beautiful vfx and cgi.,30 September 2021
festenstein, SO AMAZING,"I heard that this film was going to be good, and it was better than I had imagined!! The storyline was really new and exciting for the mcu, the fight scenes were fantastic I couldn't keep my eyes of the screen. It also had its funny parts just like marvel always has! I can't express enough how much I enjoyed this film.",3 September 2021
cbread208, Better than expected!,"I was pleasantly surprised by the twist and turns in the plot. Great acting and a great script! A very good movie! A very well balanced storyline and spectacular special effects, and great martial arts scenes. I also liked the comedy.",29 December 2021
tkdlifemagazine, One of Marvel's Best To Date,"Among the best Marvel films and characters of the entire Universe of movies. This is a moving and complex story that really resonated with me. The characters are all three dimensional and the performances are heartfelt. The action and martial arts choreography is among the best of the Marvel films. The humor, fueled by Akwafina's performance, is right on point. This film dances around the edge of the rest of the Marvel Universe but it is it's own sort and its own self contained world. You do not need to know this character, or have seen any other Marvel movie to enjoy this one. Simi Liu is larger than life in the lead role. Michelle Yeoh, Tony Leung, Benedict Wong, Fala Chen, and Menger Zhang are terrific in the ensemble cast. Many back story films are boring or wait too long to get into the action- not this one. I can't wait for a future installment.",14 November 2021
faraazattar, I enjoyed it!,"Though this film had quite lame and straightforward storyline but it's amazing direction, fantastic acting by all the cast members, beautiful visuals and cgi work, action sequences and the balance between humor and emotion makes it 10 times better film and a treat for marvel fans. It carries a great potential for the future of the MCU. For me this is the best film of 2021 until now and I truly enjoyed it and hope to see Shang Chi more in the MCU.",7 September 2021
Lythas_85, always the same,"Feminism at its best from the start..
he has got to go but the useless friend insert herself into the trip and do not take no for an answer and he needs to explain himself and prove his worth to her.. yadayada
and his sister.. of course she needed to knock him out.. and what did he say to the american chinese girl.. she was not allowed to train but he watched and learned how to do it better ... oh ok then, that totally happens alright.. but always with female characters... did we see something like his in black widow or ms marvel? Nah, in these movies only women are allowed to be empowered..they get to the forbidden city... the usually female friend becomes a natural sharpshooter with her bow... and the sister just needs her chain knife throwing thing and encouragement from her aunt and she is ready.. while the guy gets beaten up by his aunt learning how to fight wind leaf style.. and he looks like a beginner even tho he has trained since he was a little boy.The story was alright.. thank god at least he got to slay the big bad monster.. i thought his sister was going to do it even tho he is the main character..anyway, first post credit scene was ok.. not sure why the female friend was there.. she does not have any supernatural artifacts.. i guess she will be comic relief but more importantly plot armor and the fact she is a woman and cannot die.Average movie.",15 January 2022
Bigg_Bad, Decent but kind of meh,"The movie as a whole is a decent watch. It has some great ideas and fight scenes, but it all just seems a little shallow, and like the movie is scare of commit to anything so it just ends up falling like none of the great potential ever amounts to any thing.The actor who portrays Shang Chi does a good job, but he unfortunately does not get much depth to work with, he starts and ends his character ark at basically the same spot, he does not really get any moments to express any real emotion.For me there are 3 main problems.1. The sister character is only there to show a female character can be a badass...""we know, don't cram it down our throats"" it makes it feel forced, and takes away the impact of the character. But the main problem of focusing so much on her is that the main character in the story never really gets enough time to develop a character.2. The Mandarin, never feels really intimidating og loving, they try to be so middle of the road on everything with this character, that he neither feels believeable as any of those opposites or as ""real person"" in general. A shame because I don't think the actor is to blame, it is simply poor writing and directing.3. Shang Chi, doesn't feel like he has much impact on the story, especially in the second half, where the is more focus on secondary roles than him. And his impact on the final battle is minimal at best. The first half of the movie is clearly the stongest, and goes kinda downhill from there.There is one special cameo though, that is sure to delight and give some laughs.Over all it was worth a watch, but not much more than that.",4 September 2021
StevieG338, Good film!,"Really good film, the tone is great, funny when it should be, fight scenes are great, the story is great, and the cast is brilliant - with one exception, Awkwafina is awful but it is what it is.Definitely recommend anyone to see this, really good.",4 February 2022
dumsumdumfai, Miscast,"I'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast. Or is it because Tony Leung and Awkwfina stole the show? Hmmmmmm......While the MCU movies are getting too formulaic I'm hesitant to say the next 10 year is starting out rather uninteresting. Shang Chi is basically a Chinese cash grab in the lineage of Black Panther. It is uninspiring, routine and CGI oriented.Back to casting the main lead, I'm suggesting either John Cho (star trek, Cowboy Bobep,) or Chang Chen (Dune) would be an upgrade. While Falan Chen is sufficient the role is a thankless one. As to the story I would love to see more of grandma and take out Ben Kingsley's.I mean Hawkeye series is better, if how so ever slightly. I understand the fantastic elements are tributes to the Chinese culture. Of course Kingsley and that strange pet is trying hard to be comedic but is rather forced. Overall it's a surface scratcher only. So disappointed.",31 December 2021
otoyaalejo, Great movie,"I thought the movie was really great. The fight scene, the story, and the character. I would definitely recommend this for people to watch.",16 September 2021
nycweboy1, Fine addition to a genre that's wearing thin,"The ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Wakanda"" layering on of endless flashbacks and ""ancient legends"" gets a bit thick (and sags noticeably in the back half), but overall this addition of an Asian superhero story hits all the right notes, powered mainly by 2 early bravura action sequences (scaffolding on the side of a high rise mirror glass tower is especially well rendered). The performances are solid, if not exactly groundbreaking (Michelle Teoh especially has little new to do), and the direction is serviceable. But the whole thing ends in yet another CGI heavy big bass fight that is just... well, way too predictable. Snazzy post credit sequence teases Dr Strange but also adds more mystery to the 10 Rimgs... which is becoming Marvel's staple out: always teasing better content next time. Even that's wearing a bit thin.",6 September 2021
unpaid_movie_critic, A guy who could easily kick Thanos @$$!?,"Without any doubt the high quality of the picture, good story concept, and surprisingly nice incidental music. However, the amount of product placement and advertisement were just tremendously toxic, so it is really disturbing and very annoying. C'mon guys you just inserted a BMW commercial for 10 minutes!? Moreover, the scenario either has a strong scent of the ""Fathers and Sons"" (I. Turgenev) or ""Poor is the pupil who does not surpass the master"" (Leonardo da Vinci) theme. It is not bad but it is kind of predictable and creates an expected scenario that is full of clichés. Additionally, the language in this movies like ""$#it"" or ""v@g1n@"", reminds me about Captain America, ""Language"" ;) Last but not least, this movie kind of brings a lot of questions and confusion as a part of the Marvel Studios movies series in regards to the world pattern history where all superheroes, and particularly ""Avengers"".P. S: It is much better then ""Black Widow"" (2021) and more interesting then ""Eternals"" (2021) but it is not even close to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), or ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" (2021). Overall it is a good movie and kind of, or on the level of ""Black Panther"" (2018).",20 January 2022
joshe303, Another Acceptable MCU Film,"While I wouldn't sit for a rewatch, Shang-Chi was a fine feature film. The action sequences we're for the most part solid, highlighted by an early duel between two masters of martial arts which took great inspiration from the light and flowing fights of traditional Asian movies a la ""Crouching Tiger"". On the other end of the spectrum was the rushed and dull car escape about two-thirds the way through. Many other parts of the movie fell along a similar spectrum: our protagonist and his sister were rich and flowing characters, while their friend Katy and much of the supporting cast felt rushed and dull. Additionally, the movie spends a significant amount of time painting lore and background knowledge while skirting around essential questions, like, ""What is the function of the 10 rings?"" ""What is the prejudice between Xu Wenwu and the residents of Ta Lo,"" and ""Did Shang-Chi actually get stronger in his late training sequence?"" The writers seem to feel that a lot of things needed to happen for the movie to work, and while the rush between characters, moments and events isn't clumsy, it is rarely very satisfying.",2 January 2022
deedee0, The Chinese version of Harry Potter finds Wakanda,Disney made a terrible copycat of the Black Panther. The script was racially stereotypical and predictable. There was not one original idea in this movie. The CGI was pretty bad as well. Way too much swearing. Can one Marvel writer not come up with a funny response instead of a curse whenever something blows up? I am pretty much done with Disney at this point.,4 December 2021

You got action, fight scenes, CG, and a decent share of jokes here and there. But beyond that, Shang Chi is another wasted opportunity, because the plot is so shallow it really makes no sense. I never quite get why Shang Chi hated his dad so much, nor exactly what his dad's feeling is towards his kids. The plot takes you whatever way is convenient to get to the next big scene, and there is no character development or even any consistency. Nevertheless if you are fine with an action adventure roller coaster and don't care about acting or story telling, this one fits the bi. Solid 7 from me.",4 September 2021

there are better Jet Li or Jackie Chan movies in my opinion if you are into the genre ..
i get it , it's a marvel movie , people feel like is super different and well I guess it is in a way but to me many key points are terrible forced .. the acting is bad , sorry but it is .. I think awkafina was ok but a little to much as the corky sidekick... and sadly I couldn't find appeal with the lead actor ..",24 November 2021
ktoddm, Very pleasing to watch.,"Most beautiful Marvel movie there's ever been. The set design, world building, and character choices - all top notch. Possibly the best fight choreography I've ever seen in a movie, outside of traditional Kung-fu films. I could see myself putting on this movie over and over again without getting bored of it. Absolutely beautiful work of art. Plot points definitely were meant to set up action scenes, but that's what a fighting film is supposed to do. Some acting choices were a little off, but I'm willing to sacrifice that in order to have experienced fighters play the roles. Tony Leung crushed it, absolute standout. Simu Liu was a treasure. Awkwafina made in a blast. Michelle Yeoh and Fala Chen added an amazingly beautiful artistry and depth to the movie.",7 September 2021

Theese characters could have easily have been introduced inside a bigger story. The plot was sooo weak and the bad guys lacked personality completely. The dragon and the soul eater fight was aweful. It gave the Marvel universe nothing at all. This movie will have a very hard time fixing up a sequel.Nothing to engage the audience. Mediocre visual effects as well, very unlike Marvel standard. On the whole, a weak Movie.",13 November 2021

VINDETTAUS, Created an account just to review this.,"I was really looking forward to this movie. Initially, I was a bit upset that I wasn't going to be able to watch it on Disney+. However, after experiencing it on the big screen, I was so thankful I HAD to go to my local theatre to watch it. As a Chinese Australian, you rarely get to see characters that are similar to you. It was so nice to see asian experiences displayed unapologetically on the screen. The reviews that discuss how next level the martial arts are, really were telling the truth. I have seen plenty of Chinese dramas where martial arts is displayed full on & I always found myself thinking the filming direction was a bit off. This movie combined martial arts from the Chinese dramas & it was so natural and perfectly impactful. It is definitely not like the action shown in 2020's Mulan. The SFX was STUNNING, it's better than what the other Marvel movies have shown & we were just amazed at the effort and details that were placed.I'm no acting major so I don't know my stuff but I did find some of Simu Liu's facials to be a tad awkward or a little too exaggerated however, he was still, nonetheless, wonderful in this role. Tony Leung, my god, he was the moment. He really shone in this movie for me. His natural swag & cool demeanour was so attractive and I really could not hate his character. I enjoyed Awkwafina's acting in this movie, she really knows how to deliver humorous lines & I'm glad she had an impactful part in the movie & wasn't just the comedy relief.It did hurt to see that my cinema wasn't packed especially since my area is full of Asians. They may have not known about the movie since Marvel barely did any advertisement for it. I definitely hope in the future I get to see more support for Shang-Chi & the other members.Regarding the credit scenes: the mid credits scene was definitely a ""huh, that's interesting"" moment but probably not something to cause any uproar over. I'm interested to see where it goes.Overall, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. There was so much Mandarin incorporated in the movie that I am able to take my parents to watch it too!",1 September 2021

Another solid proof that Hollywood doesn't have the capability for a good movie with Chimes elements. A mixed-up with all kinds of cheesy plots and poor imitations from other movies. I bet Marvel only spent 1/10 budgets of Spiderman3 on this one. A total waste of time!!!",23 November 2021

ScottBang, Silly and Poorly Written HUGE Step Down for Marvel,"For all intents and purposes this movie was your typical DC movie. And, for a MARVEL film that's every bit the insult it is intended to be. The over-the-top praise this effort has generated is either born from pure loyal slappies or people wishing to seem culturally progressive praising a ridiculously shallow cotton candy movie.Every character is superficial and the lead has the charisma of wet bread. The story itself is basic and never gives the viewer a chance to connect with ANY character or even their motivations. The tone jumps everywhere as if the director was handed a jigsaw puzzle worth of scenes and asked to string them together to frame CGI madness. Honestly from the completely silly over-the-top opening bus brawl through the insane CGI third act dragon fight, I don't remember ever rolling my eyes so much at a Marvel Studios endeavor. Well, maybe the third act of Black Widow but that just makes me realize how far Phase Four has wandered away from what made the MCU great. There are some visually stunning scenes and an overall good idea at play but everything falls in to some sort of kiddy cartoon category where nothing has any consequence either physically or emotionally.",8 September 2021

Saft_Chri, Beatiful,The scenes in this movie are great. The pictures look fantastic and the Chinese world is wonderfully filmed. The characters are well-written and the villain is arguably one of the MCU's best. Really fun and good movie. Highly recommended.,19 September 2021
timeblank, The Best Part is the Little Details,"Shang - Chi had some great elements. The Martial Arts, Choreography, and a few Easter eggs. The bad is when their is forced humor in a serious moment.The few best details was the characters you were familiar with in the other MCU movies. Wong, Abomination, and Trevor the fake Mandarin from Iron Man 3. I love these great surprises.The Martial Arts were also great. It felt more of a Rush Hour and Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon feel to it.The movie had a family element to it. Tragic for Shang-Chi but when things get serious, and why does the studio want forced humor? We do not need Karaoke. But they make it a joke.In the end, I enjoyed it but I don't think it the best MCU movie ever compare to Avengers Infinity War and Endgame.",11 September 2021
cardsrock, Showcases the possibilities of Phase 4,"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.Shang-Chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the MCU and really stands out as a unique entry in the long-running series.",16 September 2021
hongswilliam, Diversity matters and this shows it,"Coming from an Asian American upbringing, I saw parts of my personal story play out on the big screen.

Tony Leung specifically did a wonderful job depicting a complex father, something that we all can relate to in some shape or form. Marvel needs to invest in this franchise heavily.",21 September 2021
vjnambu, Simply entertaining,"When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films. But after the pandemic, i slowly started losing interest in the film because i felt that mcu won't be as good after endgame and my fear turned true with the post endgame movies. None of the films or series satisfied me. I saw shang chi with low expectations and got fully satisfied.What i loved about shang chi the most was its entertaining. Post endgame, mcu got burdened with expectations to connect their films into a universe, set up future films and do something different but in that process forgot to provide entertainment. On the other hand, shang chi is not burdened with any of these and tells a simple and independent story. There is no deliberate connecting to the mcu, nor they are in a hurry to set up any sequels, also its not anything different as its a typical Chinese martial arts mythological film. The action scenes in train and skyscraper were mindblowing and best hand to hand action scenes after winter soldier(which black widow failed to provide). The female stars were also badass. The climax cgi action was okay.Only drawback is there is nothing new in the plot as its that typical mcu storyline where our hero has daddy issues.On the whole, shang chi and the legend of ten rings is a very good standalone mcu film after thor ragnarok.",16 November 2021

susannaaleksanyan, A generic marvel movie,"Today I watched the movie ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings."" Overall I quite enjoyed it, but there are a few things I believe could have been done better.First of all there are the characters. Shang Chi himself I believe was lacking when it came to his personality. Both Xialing and Katy had traits that were simple, interesting, and easy to follow. Throughout the film Shang Chi goes from being a less extreme version of Katy to a less extreme version of Xialing. This causes him to be forgettable, as there is a more interesting character with the same personality in the film at all times. It would have been nice to see some of his own traits that are unique and fresh.I think the development of the main heroes could have been more evenly spread across the whole film, as the only noticeable changes I witnessed were after they had reached the village.I think it is also important to talk about Shang Chi's father. He was a very three dimensional character and I really enjoyed his interactions with his son during their final fight. The only thing I would have liked to change about him would be to see him be affected by his old age, surely being around for so long would give him some sort of wisdom. Something that confused me was whether or not he was supposed to be redeemed in the end, as the way other characters felt about him was very inconsistent. While this could have been a fun concept to explore, seeing how his children felt about him and how unsure they were, it was not done correctly. Their feelings changed quickly and it was not shown to us enough for it to be something the audience recognised.The next thing I would like to talk about are the rings. They were confusing, inconsistent, and not explored enough. The abilities the rings possessed were not clear. In one scene Xu Wenwu will take down an army, then lose to one woman. Though she was aided by her powers, many of the moves Xu Wenwu showed during the opening could have been used in many other situations during the film. The rings are built up to be something that can grant you god like powers, but they end up being underwhelming. It does not make sense that Xu Wenwu is not able to take down the Ta Lo army. The people of Ta Lo possess abilities granted to them by the great protector but these powers are never explained or shown. While not all things have to be explained, this movie had too many questions left unanswered. While the after credits scene alluded to an explanation of the rings' origins, I am looking at this movie as a standalone project. None of the magic is given an explanation, that includes the rings and the great protector.My third point will be the plot and the execution of the whole film. The plot was not well done. Many of the points were rushed and introduced very out of nowhere. These points include the introduction of Trevor and Morris. It was a little too convenient that they met someone who just happened to live with something from Ta Lo, and just happened to be able to understand it, and was also willing to help them. Another thing would be the exposition. A few times during this film I felt as if a book was being read to me. There are better ways to tell a backstory than for a character to tell it to us directly. The death of Shang Chi's mother also seemed very random. It seemed as if it was not thought about at all. The gang that killed her was never mentioned before, and they were nor important to the plot in any way, so much so that they were shown to be killed not much after. I also feel it would have been better for Shang chi and his friends to stay in Ta Lo for longer until his father shows up. This is because it would give Katy time to learn about the bow and arrow much more realistically.The climax, which would be when the dweller in darkness appears. The dweller is, like the rings, built up to be something very powerful and ends up being underwhelming. Everything slightly before and after this was rushed, such as the introduction of the gate, which, like many things, was shown through a voice over. It had not been shown before this and we were not given the time to actually think about the dangers it may possess. The appearance of the great protector was also very random and, again, underwhelming.Lastly, the ending. It also made no sense for Shang Che to be able to defeat the dweller that easily, as his father, who had a thousand years to master them, was not able to. If he was also aided by the power of the dragon, this should have been stated. I do think the scene of everyone honoring the dead was done well, and was important for showing how much was sacrificed during the battle.Many of the problems I talked about could have been fixed with better timing, the right foreshadowing, better exposition, and more consistency. All in all I really enjoyed this film, though that may seem a little contradictory with how much I criticised it. I would recommend this film for anyone who enjoys cool action and cool visuals, also if you're looking for fun female characters. I would rate this movie a 7/10.",7 September 2021
abalpn-99472, A triumph! Marvel has done it once again! The action and choreography are excellent and perfect. 👍👍,"We watched the film on Disney+ and it blew our minds away. I like the cast. Simu Liu is awesome as Shang-Chi and he nails every action sequence. Awkwafina is hilarious and she saves the film with all the humor parts but the action and fight sequences are perfect. Michelle Yeoh is great in the film and I've seen her in films like Tomorrow Never Dies and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. The special effects are beautiful to see and this what makes the MCU very cool. I've seen martial art films from Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Donnie Yen. I love martial art films and superhero films. All two types of films combined into one.",15 November 2021

dannylee-78082, Solid solid,"**What I didn't love**Some decision making by the characters were a little bit off-putting and unclearMotivations likewisePlot, pacing, storyline were a little off in some places (e.g. Shang chi's power progression was a questionable moment for me; bit of an abrupt ending)Theaters are really trying to milk the pre-show value... it was close to 35 minutes dammit**What I liked (Not in a particular order)**Great music. Gonna check out the actual soundtrack (BIBI is on it!!)CG was straight up amazing. In comparison to some recent Marvel movies I watched (cough black widow cough), they really pulled it off on this oneAwkwafina is hilarious. She really carried this movie. Added the lightness that is present in all Marvel moviesRings as a weapon is SUCH an amazing concept. They really visualized it wellMartial arts actions scenes were not as cringe as I expected (except for the one where they fall in love)I really appreciate the growing Asian representation in Hollywood films. They really did a good job making it culturally ""Asian"" but not cringe like... some other examples!Overall, pretty solid Marvel film - I hope to see this franchise grow and evolve as this movie was by far not perfect but really good for a starter;",7 September 2021
nathanleefen, Nice One Marvel,"Despite maintaining some of Marvels signature (and sometimes tedious) tropes, Shang Chi shines through as one of my favourite MCU films OF ALL TIME! The action was simply put - Epic. This movie had some truly awesome moments, a fantastic debut for these characters. Shang Chi grabs some of the best parts of Chinese Martial arts cinema and Marvelises them while making it work. Going in to this movie I honestly expected to dislike it given how predictable marvels films have gotten and generally suffering from Marvel bloat but Shang Chi surpassed my expectations and gave me two hours of awesomeness. Side note: The only thing that would've made this movie better is less of the marvel quips and cheese.",5 October 2021

wayneswonderlandwindows, HIDDEN DRAGON MEETS THE MARVEL UNIVERSE,"I must say this is definitely one of the better Marvel instalments ,its a fantastic thrill ride from start to finish were the ancient world of Chinese martial arts intertwines with the ever developing Marvel universe , Jackie Chan like martial arts brings comedy to the fight scenes and we mite be looking at the new HIDDEN DRAGON here in Simu Liu who mite possess the potential to fill a martial arts void left behind by the masters Lee , Chan , Li & Yen. The ten rings are powerful and yet their power lies within the wielder so the balance between good and evil will depend on who wears them , hidden worlds , mythical dragons , magic & sorcery will it be enough to repel an ancient evil buried in time or will the 10 rings be possessed by a new spirit hidden in the heritage of ancient people, brilliantly executed adventure and gives hope to the Marvel universe so I say more of the same for future projects because I was getting worried,",6 February 2022

Its a must watch in theaters.Thanks.,4 September 2021

rick_forget, Loved it overall,"I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were really strong. I liked the fight scenes. It's about time Marvel had some martial arts with an Asian background in it. The plot was good and seemed to flow well. The humour was good. They tied it in well with some post endgame comments and hidden things in the background. I really hope they continue with this movie and possibly a new Avengers movie. The only parts I didn't like were minor and it's toward the end, but I'm not spoiling it. It is definitely worth watching though. I want to watch again.",17 November 2021

deepfrieddodo, Bold & Brilliant,"A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise. With it's foundations built on choreography and humour, Shang-Chi beautifully brings in elements of famed Kung-Fu films and Chinese culture.The cast, perhaps largely unknown in most of the world, perform excellently and those performances are centred on the movements within the film. Taking inspiration from many martial arts, the action scenes - whilst exaggerated and outlandish in comparison to the film's peers - are brilliant. The addition of Kingsley is truly excellent too, as he and Awkwafina provide the majority of laughs.A standalone plot whilst maintaining links to the MCU, Shangi-Chi creates a new platform for Marvel to explore, although clearly sets up the next Phase along with other releases from the year. The standout element is the creation of the new world and it's creatures though, a huge Disney budget bringing to life fabled animals long deserving of a spotlight.",14 November 2021
cfaion, Marvel at its Prime,"Shang-Chi is 2.5 hours of your life well spent by basking in the glory of a compelling, profound story with absolutely breathtaking visuals. It's so easy to get lost in the majesty of the world that's being portrayed and to feel like this is your life for a short period. That being said, the movie is a double edged sword; not in terms of the movie itself, but rather the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole.Shang-Chi evokes a feeling that I've only experienced from two other Marvel movies: Black Panther and Dr. Strange. After 10+ years, the whole ""America will save the world"" and ""America is the center of everything"" vibe has grown dull. What these three films all have in common is that they do not focus on the ""America first"" mentality that has been the case with MCU films for so long. They make the universe in which these stories are taking place feel so much richer.The movie starts off with something that I cannot recall ever having been done in an MCU film before: dialogue that is not English. The Chinese dialogue with subtitles automatically makes you feel like this is something different, in the best way possible. What's more, there are numerous instances across the film where characters speak Chinese, which makes the experience feel so much more culturally authentic.The fighting scenes are unlike anything seen in any other Marvel movie. There is a fluidity to the characters' movements which feels like dancing. These moments alone make the movie a must see.The special effects are beyond satisfying. The creatures based on Chinese legends look so lifelike that you genuinely feel like they could exist out in nature. The Great Protector in particular is jaw dropping and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time it's on-screen. Furthermore, any moment involving the Ten Rings is pure visual delight.As for the story, a perfect balance is struck between a grounded human experience and an otherworldly mystical journey. The heartfelt family conflict moments are not the kind of cheesy stuff you usually get in a high budget superhero movie. You really feel for what the characters are going through and are genuinely concerned for their well-being. Furthermore, the otherworldly aspect of the story fits in perfectly with the aforementioned conflict. There are a lot of abstract concepts and creatures that wield strong mystical powers, and when you reach the end of the movie you might think to yourself ""I don't really understand everything that I just saw"". However, that's part of the beauty of this movie. It bridges whats familiar and easily understood with stuff that's very unfamiliar and difficult to comprehend, which leaves you both satisfied and full of wonder.For the longtime MCU fans, Wenwu perfectly explains all the references of the Ten Times dating back to Iron Man 1 and how good organization worked. Trevor Slattery also makes an appearance and plays a pretty significant role in the film, which fulfills the longtime wish of Marvel fans to learn about his fate. His humorous role from Iron Man 3 is perfectly preserved, yet he's also given purpose beyond simply being a joke character. The character is ultimately very satisfying and surpassed all expectations.I could keep going on and on about how great this movie is. It's truly a Marvel masterpiece and deserves all the accolades it will inevitably receive.",3 September 2021

Then there's the script and a racing poorly paced story. Even if the actors were giving their all it couldn't save this ...I might've rated this higher if I hadn't already had to watch black widow this year ...not to mention crap like mortal kombat and snake eyes its on that level just stop marvel, take some time off think about your product and come back strong .",12 November 2021
MrDHWong, Elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the second film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Starring Simu Liu, Tony Leung, and Awkwafina, it elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture.In San Francisco, Shaun (Simu Liu) works as a parking valet along with his close friend Katy (Awkwafina). Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun is hiding important secrets from her - he is in fact a skilled martial artist whose real name is Shang-Chi and he has run away from his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), the leader of the powerful Ten Rings organisation. After some Ten Rings members attack the pair of them on a bus, Shang-Chi discovers that they have stolen a valuable pendant given to him by his mother Li (Fala Chen) before he left for the United States. Shang-Chi grows concerned that the Ten Rings' next target will be the pendant belonging to his younger sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), and so along with Katy he sets off to look for her before the gang can locate her first.Now that the Infinity Saga has concluded, the time has come for some new heroes to enter the MCU. Of course, there are so many to choose from, considering the large roster of characters that have come into existence over the last several decades. Although Shang-Chi wasn't the first one to come to my mind when predicting who would lead the charge of fresh faces into Phase Four, his debut big screen outing ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" successfully cements him as a memorable hero just as worthy as any other past Avenger.What I believe separates this film from the typical hero origin story is all of the interesting aspects of Asian culture it integrates into the story. I'm all for inclusivity in movies, so long as it isn't shoehorned in there for the sake of appeasing a political agenda, and here it succeeds greatly thanks to the wide array of Asian crew members who worked hard to ensure that virtually all customs are represented. The film never precisely establishes the place Shang-Chi's family is from (though it is hinted to be somewhere in mainland China), as they are seen observing various cultural traditions that don't quite narrow things down to one particular Asian country. For example, there are martial artists resembling Shaolin monks, who are supposed to be from China, seen using techniques from Japanese and Korean folklore. This has likely been done on purpose to ensure that all Asian audiences feel included, but never so much that it comes across as disrespectful. After previously bungling Asian-related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""Mulan"", ""Shang-Chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from Disney to all of their viewers.At this stage, it feels pointless to complain about Marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so I won't hold that against this one too much. With that said, thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals, director Destin Daniel Cretton (""Just Mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking MCU films to date. One scene near the beginning features Xu Wenwu walking through a bright, beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground. A short time later, he is locked in hand-to-hand combat with his future love interest Li. This reminded me of ""wuxia"" films, a popular subgenre of Chinese martial arts movies, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In fact, this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that I almost forgot this was a Marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic Kung Fu films my dad used to show me when I was young. You know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both Marvel and Kung Fu movies.Considering the last thing I saw him in was the sitcom ""Kim's Convenience"", Simu Liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star. I was expecting him to be a wisecracking Americanised version of the Asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight, only responding humorously when absolutely necessary. His dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father Tony Leung. In fact, Leung's character Xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole MCU, which I won't spoil here. Another surprise was Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend Katy. Rather than being another typical love interest, Katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be. It also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief.With a new superhero now officially introduced, it's safe to assume that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the MCU. Its broad appeal to Eastern and Western audiences alike as well as the usual action-packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the MCU to date. The Marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are, it won't be stopping anytime soon.I rate it 8.5/10.",14 October 2021
yusuftyer, Fantastically Cultured,"The movie starts with a beautifully narrated and visually stunning story. This is always important to engage the audience from the first moment. This becomes a norm throughout the film.Marvel films are well known for their pop culture references but this movie does not fall into the trap of putting in references just for the sake of it. There is a perfect balance of comedic relief and heartfelt moments.The characters are well constructed, especially Shang-Chi, Xialing and the Mandarin. However, I felt that Katy lacked depth.The movie ended strongly with conflicting feelings about the antagonist. The movie leaves you thinking about it days after it ends.I would definitely rate this among the best marvel movies of all time, and a very good movie overall!",5 September 2021

wisdomwasp, Marvel delivers again,"I didn't have the highest hopes for the first film of the new phase of Marvel characters post Avengers, but similar to the first Ant Man I was pleasantly surprised. You know with Marvel the entertainment will be big with colourful action scenes with sharp humour, and this film delivers in spades.The main character Shang-Chi is a solid lead with A strong back story and the film builds at a decent pace to its conclusion. Also a couple of great cameos from previous films, with one of the most ridiculous characters of the marvel cinematic universe absolutely hilarious and getting the best lines of the film. There was a female comedic foil in this film, but unlike the Thor movies (all of them) she never got annoying.The film is worth seeing for the bus fight alone, which is one of the best action sequences I've seen in a while, although We're so spoilt for choice these days it perhaps won't stand out like it should.MINOR SPOILER ALERT - the bad part of the film is the sister, because she's just a bit ridiculous - firstly she learnt just by watching and imitating the men do martial arts-now anyone who knows learning any kind of sport is the best way to get good is to do, not watch. And she also started a fight club, in Macau, on her own? Which streams on the...dark web? (It is a movie, maybe I expect too much). Also the post ending scene bringing in the two most annoying Avengers characters being quite annoying didn't get my hopes up for the next films.By now you know the Marvel formula. If that's your thing, like it is mine, it won't disappoint.",13 November 2021

ksharath1999, Watchable Martial Arts Fest,"Shang-Chi, the second movie from MCU's Phase 4 is a typical MCU movie but this time with some chinese martial arts that provides a different feel to some extent. Well choreographed martial arts sequences that are shown throughout the movie is the main factor that makes the film watchable. Village visuals that depict a Chinese culture to a small extent is another factor to watch out for. The movie does not have any particular acting performances worth praising yet Tony Leung's decent portrayal of a simple yet complex villain and Simu Liu's attitude as Shang chi makes them right choices for their roles. Also surprise return of a familiar character and well designed CGI creatures adds to the pros of the film.Still Shang-Chi is dragged down due to a lot of factors including a average predictable plot. Flawed VFX which is spotted the most during the third act degrades the movie quality a lot than expected. The movie fails to provide the goosebumps that a typical MCU movie provides. Last but not the least the shared universe scenes look forced compared to the well directed post credit sequence.Shang-Chi :The Legend Of Ten Rings is a satisfying martial arts fest but a disappointment when it comes to a MCU movie.Rating:63%",15 November 2021
wmshd, Worth the Watch,"Overall a good movie. The plot falls more on the cliché side, but is still interesting no doubt. Loved the use of culture. Also loved the fact that the main protagonists were written to have relatable personalities which allowed for more humorous moments. One thing I didn't particularly like was the use of the mythical creatures. Throughout the whole movie, Shang-Chi's father was pinned as the bad guy. Once the father was defeated, it already felt like an ending but the magical creatures appeared and it somehow turned into Shang-Chi's ultimate fight.",4 September 2021

emryse, Some Underwhelming Parts but very Good on the Whole,"I've been watching Marvel films for years and while I do almost always enjoy them I often come out underwhelmed, Shang Chi actually managed to pleasantly surprise me and while I do think it dragged slightly in the third act I really enjoyed it.The film manages to balance it's humour and seriousness far better than other marvel property's and also incorporates aspects from other films without feeling too forced, instead adding to the worldbuilding. The action is possibly the best of any Marvel film and obviously takes a lot of influence from Jackie Chan films with I believe the stunt coordinator having worked with Chan in the past. The acting is all good with Simu Liu really shining and while I wasn't a massive fan of Awkwafina's character at the start I did find myself liking her development in the final act, I think Shang Chi manages to take what works so well about the MCU and polish it but this doesn't mean it's without it's flaws.I did enjoy the emotional link between the villain and Shang Chi, but I thought that there were far too many flash backs telling us of how this relationship has developed, I also think that the third act was a bit of a let down with the action evolving into pretty basic CGI fights and most of the personal edge that lent itself so well to the rivalry between Shang Chi and Win Wu being lost. There are also some big plot holes and things that just don't make sense, the score is underwhelming and I'm not a massive fan of some of the villain's costume designs, however while this film does have it's flaws it was still a very enjoyable movie that I will likely watch again, the cast is good, cinematography different from the usual stuff the MCU has to offer and I like that Marvel didn't shy away from using a lot of subtitles and having characters speaking lot's of Chinese. Very enjoyable and I'd recommend it to any Marvel fan. 7/10.",7 September 2021

This reminded me of how the original Avengers were perfectly cast for their roles. That said, I really have absolutely nothing bad to say about the cast. They played some distinct characters compared to the rest of the MCU with their set of quirks, stories, backgrounds and lives in general.The only small complaint that I had while watching this movie was that the movie had spent a good portion of its runtime dwelling in the past about certain characters.All in all, excellent movie with ton of flavor, great cast and amazing characters in a very dynamic story! Would definitely recommend seeing!",5 September 2021
anaaannya, Good one!,"There are flaws in every film, but ""Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings"" was a breath of fresh air for the MCU.I thought that it would be a Western-style plot to portray Eastern lore, yet I was pleasantly surprised. The amount of action was typical of Marvel's style and was certainly overdone at the start when the plot could have moved along a little faster, but there were also moments where you were simply allowed to breathe.They took the time to show character interactions that made people's bonds with one another believable and made me care about Awkwafina's character. Katy had almost none of Marvel's standard comic-relief character flaws and instead had mostly delightful interactions with Shang, there were gorgeously slowed down scenes that showed the more peaceful flow of movement of the Ta Lo people, and finally, the story was told cyclically with constant breaks back into flashbacks, rather than linearly. This less formulaic approach to storytelling left a lasting impression on me.One flaw (according to me): the instigator of the conflict is a situation in which the father can be duped by a mere voice, which is not entirely credible given that he has lived for over a thousand years and would have had to be smarter than that to have survived this long. If his grief over his wife's death had been more recent, it would have been more convincing as a motivator for his lack of critical thinking.I won't go into too many more details. Overall, this is a very good film. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but as someone who enjoys Eastern media for its emphasis on character interactions, familial/friend love, cyclical storytelling, and, on occasion, complex solutions to problems, this was a nice homage to that.",20 December 2021

Well there was some flaws, especially when it got halfway into the film, it got a little fast pace, and I am not a big fan of fast paced films, but it got better by the point where Shang chi was thinking about how his mother died, and where it showed the flashbacks, the final battle was great until wenwu died, after that I didn't even know what was happening.

The 2nd half becomes the core of the story and ofcouse felt a slight lag - which would not happened if I watched at theatres.The BGM is very good and did not overlap anywhere.

surprise powers...forming allegiances...epic fight for ending...most main characters live...
GOT got my attention(starting with the book/s) because someone major died in the first book...i was just 'cruising along' and then it was...holy FECES!(this is a word i've used as a nurse. Noone blinked. So PLEASE don't trash this review because of it. Thanks. I also could've said 'excretions', fyi).

sokay...i was DEFinitely entertained(AND surprised at how much i was enjoying it). First rate production values everywhere i could see...AND...the humor was well paced, as well...it didn't seem as long as it was because the story was well paced, as well...and when you have a story to tell it's great that it's allowed some time to tell it...how many times have you found yourself sitting in a movie seat when the credits are rolling feeling like something(s) was left out?

TharsheyN, A Marvel Masterpiece!,"This film is absolutely incredible! It starts with an explanation of the ten rings and really cool accompanying visuals showing it in use.It soon proceeds to a even cooler fight between the owner of the ten rings and the woman who would be his wife.From there the story progresses rapidly and there is always a bit of action, not to much or to less but just the right amount so that's it's balanced with story and character development.In Shang-Chi we are introduced to Shang Chi and his baby sister. Both are awesome characters and the audience will love them. The story itself focuses on their family and the ten rings, it's worked and interconnected exceedingly well.The acting in this movie is all round brilliant and the casting was just about perfect! My only gripe would be with Awkwafina, whose character and casting seem to included in the movie purely for comedic purposes. I don't find her funny personally and this was one point that was grating on my nerves throughout the movie(This is my own personal preference and opinion, you may find her a perfect casting while I don't.). Luckily (Simu's) Shang Chi and his sister (Zhang) quickly grab the viewers attention back to them and Katy(Awkwafina) doesn't affect things to much. Though I would honestly not mind seeing more of Zhang in future productions.Special effects, visuals and sounds were spared no expense and I'm glad. They were all amazing, from watching the ten rings activate, listening to the music and soundtrack of the movie to seeing the incredible scenery. My dad especially loved the film with a lot of the Tai-Chi fighting style/mixed martial arts that was employed throughout the film. Paying homage to hundreds of years of karate from China/Japan etc.Finally the way the movie introduces Chinese culture and legends to a western audience is brilliant; I'm Indian myself though born and raised in South Africa and loved the culture this movie brought to the big screen. I especially liked the fact that they spoke Mandarin when appropriate and has subtitles rather then just using English (my home language) throughout the film. Westerners will also most likely enjoy the way the presentation of Chinese culture is shown especially in the third act of the film.All in all a brilliant work of film from Marvel Studios. I am definitely going to give it a rewatch soon and am also eagerly awaiting a sequel to the movie!10/10 from me!P. S. If I meet a beautiful Asian girl who can kick ass I'm totally marrying her if she will have me xD.",13 November 2021

rhpurple, Great action movie and surprisingly hilarious!,"I was worried this movie would be a bust but it was SO much better than Black Widow AND had some great fight scenes. Though it's not my favorite Marvel movie of all time (I am a huge Marvel fan), I found it to be a decent action movie and a pretty good plot for a Marvel origin story.Tony (The Mandarin) was freaking AMAZING, some of the best acting I've seen in a Marvel movie and by far the best actor in the movie. Akwafina surprised me as I thought she was an odd casting choice but her and Simu had great on chemistry on set.

Antagonists have their legit reason to be bad and not just for the sake of ""I'm bad because yes"".Great cast, everyone made good performance.

dkodgis-34389, Like luxurious bedsheets with just a few creases,"Good movie. It has a few things off kilter. The father's patina is lilting, odd. The movie drags a bit in spots. Then there are the superb action scenes and plugged in version of an alternate universe accessible through a waterfall. Don't ask. I am beginning to tire of Chinese action sequences because they seem so much of the same but this movie has fresh stuff. The best part for me after the action scenes was Wong, drunk on his ass, singing karaoke to Hotel California. Hysterical. The ""friend""/girlfriend in the movie is really superb-so fresh and refreshing as ""the babe"". She was good. To be honest, the movie reminded me of a Broadway play that needed another week or two of shakedown yet it still clicked in enough places that you know you've got something. The family scenes early on in the movie are nice and humanizing. It's got a few rough spots; the rest is good to very good. I see this story line, the characters, and where they go in the next movie only improving.",13 November 2021

hafizhmaulan, Mandarin Colossal vibes,"The first Marvel film with a Mandarin feel. The beginning of the film feels like a Chinese colossal classic when Xu Wenwu meets Li. Fighting scenes are interesting and fun by combining Asian and Western-style fights. The plot of the story is also classic but the audience actually feels sympathy for Wenwu. The appearance of the dragon and the fighting scene of the Dragon adds to the Asian impression in this film. You could say this is an Asian-flavored Marvel film. For actors, Tony Leung's acting is undoubtedly a colossal action senior.",27 February 2022
loozzotys, Good but...,"Good cinematography, good CGI, script is OK some hilarious bits some corny bits.Great costume.But besides Tony Leung, these American movies always choose the most unattractive Chinese/Asian actors and actresses by Asian standards. There are so many more attractive more handsome actors than the one in this movie to choose from in HK and China or Singapore but they chose this guy . It is almost as if they chose the most unattractive Asian artists to make an American movie. Why is that?Reminds me in the Olympics in Tokyo, the media and American Press chose the most unattractive ugly photos of the chinese athletes to print online. I wonder why is that? Sounds like latent Sinophobia.Out of all the actors only Tony Leung's performance was great. Michelle Yeows performance is always good but her roles so predictable.So enjoyable to watch but could be better.",10 November 2021

I have nothing to say about the special effects and combat scenes though, those were amazing.Anyways, I can't say I wasted my money because it's still a nice movie, but I know that some people might not like it because it doesn't even seem to be a marvel movie.",7 September 2021

If I keep it simple then the movie is a complete cinematic experience. If you are going for the big screen experience then you shouldn't miss it.Now, except the cinematic experience. The movie lacks everywhere in terms of constructive and moving story telling. We only get to see incident after incidents and sometimes few of them doesn't make sense or felt forced as a scene.Lastly I'll say the movie didn't fall into my taste of movies since I'm more into strong story telling than breathtaking visuals.

coolsierra," Wow, wow! Best movie in a while","Well here's my review. After just reading the reviews on here I came across some bad reviews and laughed at them. Most of them are saying the villain was bad (not a spoiler: his dad) or they are saying it doesn't fit in the new marvel universe. I also saw one review who gave a 1/10 and said it was because of one of the actors in the post credits scene. For the people who are reviewing bad reviews don't like a new superheroes being Asian.The movie was a perfect it made you feel sorrow for the character and the position he was in between his father. You could feel the weight he had on his shoulders. The beginning of the movie starts with the fear of unknown, you don't know who is after him. You go through many happy and sad emotions. The movie also did a excellent job using the characters native language. The fight scenes are astonishing and the cgi was beautiful. The wasn't any cgi characters that didn't look real. The cast and crew should be proud of a beautiful masterpiece they made. Amazing amazing!",3 September 2021

I found it amazing.Another great addition to the MCU.",9 September 2021
W011y4m5, Feast for the eyes...,"I can't decide whether I loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography Bill Pope's done since The Wachowski's ""The Matrix"" trilogy?Either way, ""Shang-Chi"" is easily the most visually distinctive & stunning film in the MCU thus far - vibrant, kinetic, gorgeously framed / composed, with its own individualistic sense of personality - & the symbiosis between the fight choreography & camera work supercedes that of any previous installment in the Marvel franchise - resulting in an incredible style that works effortlessly throughout... I can't stress this enough - some moments are honestly breathtaking (my jaw was on the floor) & it's an utter joy to see such expertly constructed & perfectly timed sequences - of pure, unapologetic cinema - unfold. Allows the audience the uncommon opportunity to just sit back & relax whilst watching, safe in the knowledge those responsible for bringing the screenplay to life are trustworthy, capable hands. Hence, the creator's dependability reassures viewers that they can simply focus on enjoying the experience instead, making it even more fun.Although I shouldn't be surprised everything's captured so masterfully - considering the reliably quirky inventiveness of the visionary director of photography at the helm of the project - despite his legendary status, I still wasn't expecting a solo film (made by such an infamously corporate production company which normally shuns creative experimentation of any kind, churning out unadventurous, generic, copy + paste origin stories) to be so shockingly well realised on screen, it would consequently make ""Avengers: Endgame"" look embarrassingly trivial & unengaging by comparison... Yet somehow, under the watchful eye of director Destin Daniel Cretton, together, this duo manage to accomplish exactly that successfully, capturing scenes with a unique confidence I rarely (if ever) see in recent comic book adaptations.For instance, usually, I can't stand the bland, dull, grey, lifeless aesthetics of Disney movies (renowned for their very ugly colour grading & over reliance on CGI) but the filmmaking here feels as uncharacteristically bold, audacious, awe inspiring, original, immersive & as epic as James Wan's ""Aquaman"" or James Cameron's ""Avatar"", utilising VFX effectively to enhance the scale of the tale being told, rather than detract from the overall plot. Of course, technically impressive world building & enormous scale / grandiosity are meaningless qualities & hollow attributes to possess if the narrative lacks depth or engaging characters but thankfully, this offers just enough heart to additionally feel emotionally investable, as well as spectacular.Wish I could've seen this in the theatre.",13 November 2021

I'd pay just to watch it but then you can leave. Everything else is really bad. Especially the power scaling. The main plot devise is a weapon that is inferior to a gun. Seriously. Then theres the plot hole of ""where's all the guns"" no one has guns? Yea it's a marshal arts film but John wick was too. Then it's not like marvel can just buff this character. The only way, would be to make him move faster but no way can a human move faster than quicksilver. And quicksilver couldn't put run a bullet. The only other way to buff him is if they just gave him a gun in combination and the rings would be used for Mobility and support but it's not some power weapon.And even if he did have a gun he doesn't even scale to war-machine because war-machine is bullet proof.",5 September 2021

fillercreator-07895, what happens to put Chinese myth in a Mavel story,"It is.. impressive! Not because of the narrative which is pretty normal, nor the performance which is somewhat above average, it is impressive for the proper use of elements from Chinese myth.When the crew arrived the hidden Talo village, it is such wow! The mythical animals are exactly what I image them to be, the Long(dragon), Feng (fire bird), Kirin, Nine tail fox. It feels like they just came out of the Chinese mythical stories that passed down from generation to generation.And the Kong-fu too! The use of Tai-chi movement is smart, combining with the natural magic, the visual presentation is great! It is definitely a good movie for Kong-fu fans.The narrative is not bad, the legendary villain gave up everything for a beautiful girl, they lived happy life until his wife was killed during his enemy's vengeance. The miss of his wife led him to break the portal that blocks powerful alien monster. His son, inherited the power from both him and his wife, found his way to defeat the villain and the monster.

tonymyles," Fun, but not engaging","You may (or may not) find Shang-Chi to be a fun movie to see in theaters. The film is full of tropes, from the narration over an origin story, to an inner city urban flip on an distinctly Asian character, to the CGI we're to assume is real (that never quite does translate as real). This well-intentioned film about discovering who you are doesn't seem to know for sure what it is. For example, there is tie-in to the larger Marvel universe, but almost out of corporate necessity to set up subsequent movies versus narrative need to set up a deeper story inside itself. There's also more profanity than other films, often used as a momentary gag that doesn't advance the plot. Even the final sequences land in dark places that confuse the family storyline versus clarify it. If you're looking for a fun night out, perhaps you and your crew might enjoy this film... or you might crave something more significant.",3 September 2021

But where it's less good for me is in the decisions made by Shang chi's father.And Ben Kinsley who appeared in iron man 3 also feels unnecessary and is basically just like a simple comic reliever character.But overall, Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings is one of the better Marvel movies, with the best action and fantasy elements ever produced by Marvel studios.",13 November 2021
dukeofasgard-76422, Marvel have outdone themselves,"PART WITH NO SPOILERS
This film was absolutely amazing! Almost every aspect of the film was perfect and it smashed my expectations and took it's place as one of the best Marvel films, or any films that I have seen.The visual effects in this movie were fabulous, there were plenty of captivating scenes with astounding usage of modern technology. The cinematography was probably one of the best I have seen in a film for a while, it kept you captivated and on your toes the entire time! I also noticed light being used to make the scenes even more captivating, which is something you don't always see in films.The dialogue was solid and didn't feel clunky or wierd, the jokes were well spaced and gave your muscles a rest from being tensed.The action was perfectly filmed and beautiful, it felt like they were dancing. The choreography was very impressive.The story itself was nothing unexpected, pretty much a generic origin story, but don't worry that doesn't take away from the film at all!And lastly the villain was for me one of the most interesting aspects of the film, they made you feel for him and gave him an interesting charachter with a non-generic motive, I haven't felt for a villain this much for a long while.PS: There are two post credit scenes so stay after the credits.PART WITH SPOILERS
And I just wanted to say I loved the return of Trevvor Slattery! It was such a surprise and something they managed to keep out of the trailers, he was hilarious especially where he played dead. Also I like the fact Wong played a role in the film, the scenes with him were interesting. The post credit scenes set up the sequel which I will be very interested to see! Can't wait to find out what the sister does and who the rings are calling.",5 September 2021
purgatorypriest," A G-Rated Disney action movie, too childish for the Marvel universe","Well, I would have had more fun, I think, if I was aged between 6 and 25 years. Waaaay too many corny jokes & stupid, added plot lines to progress story, the ""tell it to me like I'm 5 years old"" type of story telling - this happens for the first 20 minutes or so along with the eye rolling scenes and bad jokes, all forced comedy.Then it gets a little bit better going, but soon after, here comes the kid gloves, the really annoying Asian sidekick/girlfriend, Aquafina something and oh, wait, not a single sign of blood or any really deaths, chopped, broken body parts shown. Like a Disney action movie for pre-schoolers at times I'd say.It has its pluses with the Excellent karate and stunts, CGI too.But man, this was not made for anyone to really enjoy a fine, 'take me away into fantasy' - not if you are over 30+ years imo. Or only if you are perhaps a huge comic nerd and man-baby.Fair rating from me, but I'd Not watch again unless I'm about 75 years old and infantile again.",14 September 2021
PyroSikTh, Phase Four is in Full Swing!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had. It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect. I give Shang-Chi a high 8/10, with promise of moving up with rewatches.",7 September 2021

CountJonnie, Character driven Marvel movie,"Marvel delivers. After various movies that could've made even hardcore fans feel over saturated, Shang Chi sets itself apart by blurring the line between hero and villain. Not focussing on good vs evil or origin stories, it focusses mainly on the development of various lead characters who never become less than 3-dimensional, and so this movie achieves what Black Panther unsuccessfully tried to be.The only critical issue is that this movie has Awkwafina, so you know you'll have to suffer through some pointless yelling which seems to be intented as funny, but never really is.",13 November 2021

drqshadow-reviews, Marvel Sprinkles a Different Flavor into the MCU,"Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films. It's a fresh mix, effectively breaking the gravity of its more serious moments with a well-timed jape while lending credence and lore to a lesser-known corner of the comic kingdom, but these crossover moments sometimes test their limits. I could see more grounded viewers being turned off by the dragons and soul-sucking demons (far cry from the feasible reality of the first Iron Man, that) while serious fans of Chinese fantasy are bucked by the constant injection of loose wit and slappy one-liners.When it's rolling, Shang Chi does manage to toe that line and deliver something appropriately new and versatile, a good reflection of both worlds. It benefits from a tight pair of central performances (Simu Liu and Awkwafina as a team of underachieving twenty-somethings) and several big, powerful action sets (the articulated bus fight might be one of the best combat scenes Marvel's ever put out) while tying in a dangling thread or two from earlier films to provide a sense of greater connection. On several occasions, however, it's guilty of being too self-indulgent and losing the narrative. It's great to see Ben Kingsley again, adding nuance to his part in Iron Man 3, but his scenes are the main offender here; excessive and distracting and way too cute.The action is strong, the dialogue (mostly) works, the scenery looks great, but in the big picture, Shang Chi feels small-scale and disposable. Non-completionists won't miss anything crucial if they choose to skip it.",3 January 2022

dfle3, Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings - enjoyably unMarvellous film. 80%,"""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Many years ago I saw ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and found the fight scenes in that literally unbelievable a lot of the time. ""Shang-Chi"" often seems subtle in its fight scenes by comparison but then does have action sequences which are more like MCU superhero films. As an origin story, it assumes no familiarity with the MCU and in fact plays mostly as a non-MCU film, which is what I liked about it.Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi/Shaun, the son of a mobster, Xu Wenwu (played by Tony Leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself, due to his legendary characteristics. Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li (played by Fala Chen) is also a legendary kind of character. This contrast of 'Eastern' legendary figures and 'Western' MCU legendary figures worked to the former's advantage, as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with.The plot concerns how Shang-Chi/Shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out, he is pulled back into Wenwu's orbit. The film mixes the seriousness, perhaps, of Chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of American Hollywood films. As should be expected from a MCU film, eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it.The martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm. Other times the action sequences seem lifted from a Disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too, if you just suspended disbelief.Speaking of comedy, I found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs, which isn't uncommon in MCU films but I warmed to later instances of it. For instance, I was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from Liverpool, when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting. That actor playing the thespian did seem familiar, perhaps for his voice but I did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for.An interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter, i.e. An Asian superhero and a mostly Asian cast. Is this another attempt by Hollywood to crack the now important Chinese market? If it is, then the cooling relations between the US and China is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for Hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from Chinese cinemagoers.Another question that came into my mind was whether ""The Ten Rings"" is based on Chinese legend or is a Marvel appropriation of Chinese culture, tailored for 'Western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity. If it isn't the former, then I think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'Eastern' legends and myths. That could be something which might interest me (Sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!).As you might have guessed, I wasn't the first in line to see this film. In fact, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to see it, as I haven't watched every line of superhero films in the MCU (maybe I should watch ""The Black Panther""?). As it stands, I think it was worth the punt in seeing it. I'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to The Avengers franchise! Furthermore, I would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the MCU, which it managed to do, at least until the closing credits, which I didn't welcome when it made its first appearance. With that being said, this is the kind of film that you could watch again, after a suitable break. Although I didn't watch this film in 3D, it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and...sometimes it doesn't).Notes to self:* The narrative did have some logical gaps in it, for example why Shang-Chi was attacked on the bus. What was that all about?* The film was dedicated to the memory of Brad Allan, I think. Not sure who that was...searching now, a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator.* Reading the closing credits, I was reminded that this film was shot in Australia, which isn't obvious watching it, so, good job studio (I think I saw or heard something on ABC in Australia about how Asian Australians got to be in this film, perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!* My score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score.",8 November 2021

SouthernViews," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Marvel","I ignored the positive reviews for this movie because I just assumed it was Marvel fanboys raving about the latest film. I was afraid this was another Captain Marvel situation. That movie made an insane amount of money at the box office, and I still feel it is one of Marvel's worst. I recently watched it a second time to confirm what a dull, formulaic movie it was. So, I assumed Shang-Chi would be the same. I was wrong.Shang-Chi is one of Marvel's best solo (non-Avengers) movies. Although it has a very long run time, the movie never drags. This is a family drama intertwined with a superhero movie. I always thought Captain America Winter Soldier was a political spy thriller mixed with a superhero movie. They've sort of taken that approach here. Remove the superhero and superpowers aspect of Shang-Chi, and you have a fantastic story about love, family, and betrayal.This movie has some of Marvel's best fight scenes. The visual effects and world-building are, for the most part, excellent. The script has just enough comedy, done at the right time, unlike many other Marvel movies where the jokes seem forced.Speaking of the script, this too is one of Marvel's best. The family dynamics and history are revealed slowly throughout the movie. This causes the viewer to stay engaged and reflect on past choices that the characters had made.I read another review that said something along the lines of ""this movie is a great example of Martin Scorcese being right that superhero movies are bad."" I feel the opposite. As I said earlier, take out the superpowers, and you have a fantastic family drama. Shang-Chi is an excellent movie, that also happens to be about a superhero.",15 November 2021

stevenworkmanc, Pretty ok,"This movie is kinda fun at first but gets old fast. Wish they had stuck to the martial arts ninja aspect more. Kinda felt like 'Batman Begins' but later it just felt like an animated movie and felt really cheesy. Also I don't like what they did with Shang Chi's girlfriend. She's funny and I enjoy her in general but they really didn't justify making her super important. Like there is no reason for her to be good at bow and arrow. Should've left her as the funny love interest and let the sister steal the show as the badass girl (cause she was well written so her fighting skill makes sense) in conclusion, this is a decent watch but wears out it's welcome about half way through.",28 November 2021

yeolit, Best movie I have watched in a while,"Amazing storytelling, kinda cliche plot, amazing acting, and most importantly, excellent presentation of it all.Action movies are famously bad at explaining various plots, be it how some things happen, how some scenes seem to inexplicitly changed to something drastically different, plot holes and so on, but Shang-Chi is probably one of the best in terms of both emotions and action, in the Marvel series.Being an Asian, and especially Chinese-centric film, it is not surprising to find asian values being incorporated inside the movie. What's surprising though, is how a lot of the movie is actually in the Chinese language. Granted, non-english speaking viewers will not be able to grasp the full meaning of some of the phrases used, a case of lost in translation, and some might even find the rampant use of Mandarin off-putting for a global audience, most of who probably do not know Mandarin. And due to some political sensitivities, no less.But outside of any prejudice or language barriers, this movie is indeed amazing in its own right. The acting of most if not all of the characters inside were really excellent, especially the facial expressions and the form of the martial arts, a lot of which seem to be referenced off tai chi.The movie does have flaws, like the use of a foreign language for a mostly English-speaking global audience, or some explanations lacking, which is partly covered by the end credits, but the way it set up the interactions between characters and the plotlines is really masterful.One of a kind, especially given today's sensitiveness on political correctness.",2 January 2022

ThatMonkey, Ring Me up!,"This movie is worthy of praise, it truly represented the people, history and lore of the legend. Early reports said this was the Asian version of Black Panther and that could not be further from the truth. Despite sales, Black Panther was hands down the worst film Marvel released, until Black Widow snatched that crown. You get invested in these characters and had they cast a better side kick other than the unattractive, not funny, Awkwafina I probably would have considered a 9 for the film. I don't know who blessed her with the Asian female Kevin Hart title, but she is awful in everything. I hate her voice, hate acting and her face is 100% Cabage Patch.I know nothing about these comics, but I truly want to know more about Changs Father and the legacy of the rings. I would assume that will be explored in the sequel, but again, the writer and director deserve praise for how they unfolded and told the story. Phase 4 was not looking promising, but this was aa strong entry and worthy of the same praise Iron Man got. Shang may be the New MCU Poster Boy. The pace probably could have been quickened. At 2:20, it was probably at least 10 minutes minimum too long.That said, it's a great story, acted and directed well and the only irritant was Awkwafina. Comparing her to Kevin Hart is an insult to Kevin, she is the Asian Female Jerry Lewis and that is one clown I could live a lifetime without having ever seen!",6 September 2021

bhgcxb, Cool,"For the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which entered its fourth phase with great difficulty - the difficult parting with the Avengers and coronavirus transfers affected - Shang-Chi will definitely not be a support project. Unless in the Chinese market, for which the film is designed. And viewers who are not fans of comics may not have heard of this hero at all. In addition, director Destin Daniel Cretton, although he has established himself as a director of good award-winning dramas and biopics with Brie Larson (she will also appear here, in the post-credits scene), had no experience in filming action scenes, which are usually a lot in Marvel films. In general, the introductory for the studio, from a commercial and artistic point of view, is not the most favorable.The more surprising is the final result. Shang-Chi is both like the very first Marvel origins and more recent and mature films like Black Panther and Doctor Strange, only without the heaps of MCU lore and pressing issues. In the first act, as is usually the case, viewers and loved ones of Shang-Chi will suddenly discover his fighting skills in a beautiful action scene on the bus, with the help of which Cretton will instantly prove his genre viability.",19 January 2022

Benjamin-M-Weilert, A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes.,"With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America. However, this means lesser-known properties like Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) get their chance to shine. And while lesser-known franchises like Guardians of the Galaxy are now household names, I think it remains to be seen if Shang-Chi can truly develop its own integrated identity within the MCU.Having somewhat botched the introduction of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) in Iron Man 3 (2013), Shang-Chi attempts to ret-con this by insisting that the Ten Rings organization is a genuine threat to world peace. However, Marvel wants to have its cake and eat it too by including the ""Mandarin"" in this film. There are a few other loose connections to the larger MCU in this film, but they are more cameo call-outs than anything significant. Overall, Shang-Chi is its own story.The fact that a good portion of this film's climax takes place in a mythical hidden kingdom made it feel disconnected from the MCU as a whole. Sure, other franchises within the MCU have their origin stories. Still, I felt they made it clear how they contributed to the ""whole"" of the larger arc by either introducing characters or concepts in prior MCU movies. Shang-Chi excels in its action and choreography but feels generic in the grand scheme of things as a standalone film. I'd almost wager that its sequel will be much more interesting and that those not already committed to the MCU can probably give this one a pass.A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes, I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 3.0 stars out of 5.",31 December 2021
mgsl-20235, good movie with some big plot holes... not a marvel movie,"I watched this with a bit of unease, but it was better than expected. It felt like several movie smooshed together and sometimes they didn't coalesce correctly. First you have the typical Chinese legend type film, crouching tiger, sword of destiny etc. With the line of forgiveness and great loss and manipulation.. but as far as integrating in to the world of marvel it doesn't do that. Explanations are left very weak so it basically becomes a high end martial arts film with the Chinese legend thrown in.Don't get me wrong, I actually liked it but I don't know why because I can sit and think of a lot of times I rolled my eyes, for instance the sister is just plain annoying and really didn't need to be in the plot and felt like she was shoe horned in... really take her out and basically it would of panned out the same but without the boring sister with a chip on her shoulder and daddy issues.",20 November 2021

So with that in mind it is still a good movie. It was good to watch with family as well. Starting of the movie was little different and waiting to see how it connects to entire movie as it happens was interesting.",13 March 2022
sarahrayburn," Wow, just wow",Shang-chi was worth the wait and the hype. I immediately fell in love with all the characters because of their charm and charisma on the screen. The fighting scenes were well choreographed and filmed. I felt like I had a front row seat to some of the most artistic and beautiful fighting sequences on the screen and MCU history. The character development was also astounding and I cannot wait to see where they go! It was a work of art. This movie's cast was perfect as well as the directing and music. It is a must see for MCU and superhero fans alike.,9 November 2021
kevinmiller-55959, The marvel you hear about,"So the best way to describe the last big release from marvel, black widow, is dull. Poor story, badly cast, terrible villain, lack lustre action.I went into this film completely ready for disappointment, and instead found it to be the perfect marvel recipe!Correct casting, everyone is perfect as far as I'm concerned.Nice pace to the story, I never felt bored.Excellent villain. I really wanted to like him even though he had done so much to hate, which is the best kind of villain.It stayed connected with what we know but challenged how we know it. Marvel needs to use this as it's foundation for film structure and continue to try new things. They also need to avoid taking beloved characters and dulling their edge over time (I'm looking at Bucky Barnes, black widow and Bruce banner specifically).What I'm saying is, see this movie. It doesn't disappoint. If you like the better marvel movies like gotg, avengers, captain America 2 etc this should nicely work for you as a mixture of the bunch.",15 November 2021
jaredd, Might need a director's cut?,"Some things are explained to death, other things are not explained at all. As frustrating as Awkwafina and her vag, which by the end of the film I was for sure left wondering about. Will she be stuck in the friend zone forever???Also, our world advances every year, but we still have massive plot holes in films? Nobody bothers checking this stuff? Weak.Some scenes were quite stupid. By the end I was ready for it to be over. And no, I'm not a monster so a few things I did like here and there, mostly revolving around Awkwafina. I really got a kick out of watching her character and I think she was a great addition to the film.",12 December 2021

Dimakovtun," Choreography and effects, not much else","The story is quite bland, and through all of it there is a feeling I've already watched the movie a long time ago. The main character and his companions make no decisions of their whatsoever, but just do what they are told to by the support actors.It's fine to watch as a no-brain fighting movie, but that's it. Just as much one could watch a Jackie Chan movie, albeit without modern CGI.",30 November 2021

looking_Work, Enjoyable But Forgettable,"Having been starved for a Marvel movie and after the fiasco that was Black Widow, I think many are rating this movie higher than it deserves.A running time of 2hr and 13 min felt more like 2 and a half hrs. Awkwafina, meant to be the comedic sidekick, was completely out of place. She had no skill set, could not speak Chinese and was not particularly funny. I did not like the pacing particularly the numerous flashbacks to the past. Instead of attempting to subvert our expectations by springing surprises on the audience as it relates to a character's character it would have worked better to have a linear timeline. Doc Ock was not shown to be evil out of the box and then through flashbacks is it explained why he is the way he is.Finally, I felt that cinematically you can see similarities between this movie and other martial arts movies released in the early 2000s (Hero, The Forbidden Kingdom) specifically in some fight scenes.",4 September 2021

lafinplace," Funny, amazing action, epic family drama - I laughed, I cried - all the feels","I loved it, and so did the boys (my 25 and 31 year old boys)! It was funny, action-packed, and there was family drama on an epic scale. There was plenty of amazing martial arts action - my favorite was the first one on a runaway bus in San Francisco with 5 assassins and our reluctant hero. Also, there were magical creatures, a tragic love story, and a battle of good and evil. My older son is always the most critical of the three of us, and he loved it. His only criticism is that it wasn't much of a Marvel movie, but as an origin story, that did not bother me. There were 2 superhero cameos, and larger parts for Wong from Dr. Strange and Ben Kingsley reprising his role (as an actor hired to play a terrorist) from the Iron Man 3. In the end, the best thing that I can say is that when we walked out, we all said that we wanted to see it again!",6 September 2021
leetheodore, Beautifully made for everyone,"Liked:
The action and fight choreography are very, very well made, and was as able to follow the actions clearly. Honestly, all the fight scenes are very well made and reminded me very much of Jackie Chan's movie, such as in Rush Hour 2 a scaffolding fight happened in this movie. This is most likely because supervising stunt coordinator, Brad Allan (which the movie dedicated to) was a member of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. The train fight scene may be one of the best of the MCU. In fact, a similar fight happened in Captain Marvel but it couldn't top this.Disliked:
Katy doesn't have a good backstory. The fact that she just hangs around with her best friend, travelling around Macao then Wen Wu's fortress and to Ta Lo. Later in third act was then be able to shoot an arrow right on the dweller's throat. The writers could've simply mention her archery or something related to her backstory so that her skills would make more sense.The CGI final battle between the Great Protector and the dweller was way over the top and obscured by thick grey fog. Couldn't follow the scenes much.",6 October 2021

kevinsweetland, Tedious...,"Maybe there are just too many super hero movies now, but I found it boring.

Was sick of nonsensical movies by Marvel and DC since long with dad jokes type of dialogues and no concrete storyline or material like Avatar. But I liked this one.

As Bollywood really sux when it comes to making such movies, they're only good at making good biopics.",18 September 2021
JoelAlexanderr, A gorgeous and thrilling superhero movie with impeccable action,"Disney and Marvel have gotten to the point in their collaboration that much of their projects together seem to look and feel exactly the same. Every time a new movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes out, it seems like each filmmaker has to prove that their project is more than just another superhero movie. Luckily, the MCU's newest offering, SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS, stands on its own as a quality action film with some of the best stunt-work and visual effects of the year. The movie is not perfect, and contains some trite ""superhero"" storytelling elements that Disney movies often rely on, but director/writer Destin Daniel Cretton's clear talent behind the camera transforms every average scene into a larger-than-life sequence with high stakes for characters that are easy to invest in.The first act of the film admittedly plays out similar to many mainstream ""hero's journey"" tales -- an average joe (Shang-Chi) turns out to have a more-than-average calling and must return to his past in order to keep his father from doing evil things that might cause many innocent casualties. It seems like a combination of ideas that have all been done before. The movie is at its weakest when it sets itself up to be as interesting as the concept of the plot, but for SHANG-CHI, the gold is in the execution of this storyline.Firstly, the characters are interesting from the very start of the movie to the end, so despite the clichés the audience still cares about what happens to every character, including the fantastic villains. The comedic relief is also on point throughout, and the characters all feel personable and colorful due to the life that each actor puts into their performances. Simi Liu as Shang-Chi is a star in the making, similar to Chris Evans' turn in the first Captain America film, and casting directors all over Hollywood will likely have him near the top of their call lists after this. The performance of the film for me, however, is Tony Leung as Shang-Chi's father and the primary villain. Leung plays one of the most lived-in and memorable MCU villains since Erik Killmonger -- it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him even though it's clear that he has some serious issues with how he is dealing with his inner demons.At the end of the day, I believe SHANG-CHI will truly be remembered for the technical mastery put into the action sequences. Only time will tell if this statement remains to be true, but it struck me while watching: this film contains the most well-filmed action sequences of any live-action Marvel movie thus far. A high-stakes fight scene on a bus about 20-30 minutes into the movie made me realize that the filmmakers weren't messing around with their action: the stunt choreography is phenomenal, the visual effects and cinematography are stunning, and the action set pieces are inventive and pay homage to great Asian cinema of the past. The final 30 minutes of SHANG-CHI involve one large final battle, and it ranks as one of my favorite final fight scenes in the MCU along with Avengers: Endgame and Infinity War.SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is not perfect, especially for those looking for a complete reinvention of what it means to be a superhero movie. It adheres to many of the standards that have already been set up for the genre, but it does so in such a stylish and sleek way that it is difficult not to smile during much of the film. Cretton does a fantastic job helming this movie in a way that sets it apart from the projects that came before it, and ends up crafting the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie that I wish we had. Superhero movies may be running out of ideas, but if they continue to be crafted this well, then we should expect to see plenty more where this came from.B+",6 September 2021
mr_sharma, Fun 2/3 and then a rather obvious and weak last third,"I enjoyed this more than Black Widow. Black Widow wasn't bad, but when you've had two great Spider-Man's, a fantastic Captain America or two and the amazing Infinity war....well Black Widow just seems meh.But why are we talking about that when now we have Shang Chi.To give it's complete title that would also include the legend of the 10 rings.Overall I enjoyed this but the pity is the weak and predictable ending. The obligatory 2 end credit scenes are also there.Where it excels is the first 2/3rds. It has a very Spider-Man feel to it in the sense of easy going humour. The fight scenes are great....although some seem simply contrived to show off martial arts being performed in a different to the usual place martial arts films usually have their fights.....but then Jackie Chan films have been doing this stuff decades ago. Still fun though.There are some neat touches involving referencing characters introduced in other Marvel films which adds a different dimension and pleases some of the fan base.But ultimately, it all winds up like a million other big budget fighting the monster in the end of film blockbuster. Lots of bangs, exposition, non sensical OTT fight scenes and a little perplexing how we even got here.It suffers from sugar coated neatness.After all, this film starts well with some dark tones along the way but ends up being too neat. Like a moral compass advert for how ideally one's life can be redeemed by not being a dick for a few seconds.Still as popcorn movies go (and boy have we missed them these past two years), this is perfectly serviceable.Nowhere on par with the two recent spideys. In fact, I'ld say if you can hold out till it gets to Disney+ next month (October 2021), watch it then for nothing more as it's included with your subscription.I must say, Marvel (Disney) are churning out same ole same ole....nothing new whereas DC are knocking it out the park.....first with the excellently unsettling Joker and the recent The Suicide Squad. With The Batman possibly delivering on it's Riddler promise, we may have a shift back to DC in terms of power balance. This is surprising to me as DC have churned out some proper crud over the years.I wish the scripts pushed the envelope by telling interesting, engaging and intelligent stories.Unfortunately, there really is nothing original or revealing about Shang Chi. It's a safe film. Fun but ultimately forgettable.",5 September 2021

Casting director choose very well the main characters of shang-che. But one boring thing is that why Ban Kingsley? That was weird character of the movie.First half is more batter than second half.

Alexander_Blanchett, The birth of a new legend,"The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.Its packed with amazing action, a great legacy and a wisely picked cast who get the chance to portray fun characters.To start with Simu Liu who shoots himself to stardom with this film. His portrayal was fun as he perfectly mixes the hero attitude with a nice tongue-in-cheek humor and perfectly develops himself without taking all of it too seriously. Same goes to his co-star Awkwafina who was perfectly cast. Having Tony Leung as the to center-part was an excellent creative decision. Then the film has some fan favorites appearing as Ben Kingsley's Trevor or Benedict Wong who round it up to a wonderful Marvel adventure, just as you would expect.The action scenes are tremendous, as the film is filled with great Martial Arts sequences, (of course Michelle Yeoh is not to be missed here). The bus scene at the beginning is a true stand out action scene in the entire Marvel universe.Really a good one for the next phase of Marvel, and I like how it links to the whole universe just perfectly. Another Marvel winner.",15 November 2021
jamiequick-53771, Wasted opportunity to make something unique,"This movie had a solid cast and some great martial arts fight sequences. Sadly, every other aspect fell short for me.The characters were a mixed bag, with a good protagonist but a villain whose backstory and motivations were incredibly generic and uninteresting. The dialogue was poor: quippy jokes were made all the way through, most falling flat and being told by the main character's best friend. The worst case was a joke between the characters and a flight attendant that interrupted the telling of a tragic backstory. This is evidence enough of the film being insecure in its own storytelling; it is so afraid that a sad moment won't land that it won't even give it a chance.Another issue with Shang-Chi was that it also couldn't decide on whether it wanted to be a serious martial arts film or a goofy Marvel movie like 'Guardians of the Galaxy', leading to the CGI-stuffed second half feeling like a massive step down in quality when it lacked the charm of something like 'Thor: Ragnarok'. The second half was made even more disappointing by how the culture that the characters ran into had incredibly generic lore surrounding them and unfortunately the CGI looked equally rushed and generic.Overall, I'm disappointed that an East-Asian-themed movie failed to deliver something unique to what we've seen previously from Marvel Studios. I was hoping for some captivating mythology or at least another cultural perspective, but instead just got more of the same. If you have small children and you're looking for a film they'll enjoy, then I'd recommend this. If not, I'd advise looking for something else.",14 December 2021

Other than that, it was visually stunning and an action packed thrill ride.",6 September 2021
saadanathan, Really enjoyable film 7/10,"Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him. Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid). Overall I really enjoyed it. There were still a few moments that I regretted and that were dull. Not to mention ""little mistakes"" that Marvel keep doing with their movies. In general it was a fun experience. The plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities. Until he is forced to face his past.This has been the kind of way for Marvel to introduce their new characters in the MCU, I wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once. Watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for Marvel. The movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""Hero"", ""Hidden Dragon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""In the mood for love"".Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original). The end credit scene does confirm the return of Shang Chi at some point, but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future Marvel films will all get connected. As I said before, I'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of Marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them. To me, I just wanted to return to the theaters.Speaking of actors: Simu Liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite, both him and his character. Awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen. Tony Leung is wonderful and acts so well. The whole cast is perfect. If you are in favor of theaters and Marvel movies than go watch Shang Chi.P. S: the end credit song - Fire in the Sky by Anderson Paak. Is the best part of the movie.",11 September 2021

Every Characters performance was brilliant. I need to mention this because without this character the movie would not be that interesting and that role is played by Awkwafina as Katy. Her comic timing was so good. And as always marvel surprised me to have the villain as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as as Xu Wenwu.

rapiddevil, Great Martial Arts Film,"This really is a good movie, particularly if you like martial arts fight scenes. It has a bit of everything, a good sense of humour, great fight scenes and even a bit of fantasy mixed in.The two lead characters were particularly good. I really liked how they mixed the American and Chinese cultures throughout the movie.The fight scenes were epic and there were plenty of them, particularly when they involved the 10 rings!There were only a couple of things that I wasn't keen on. First, the appearance from Ben Kingsley (who I'm a big fan of) didn't work in my opinion. It wasn't entirely random, those that have watched the iron man movies will know this but it appeared to be an attempt to add some comedy value to the movie which just didn't work at all. People who haven't seen the iron man series will probably think it was clueless.The second was the inevitable woke storyline (that seems compulsory with all hollywood movies now) that they had to slip in. A cliché one, girl doesn't get treated equally to the boys and so has to become better than them *sigh*.Those things aside, I really enjoyed this movie and it was great to see at the cinema.Tip: There is an end scene after the credits roll as IN ALL MARVEL MOVIES. The cinema put the lights on as they rolled but we knew one would come. We were the only 2 in the entire cinema that stayed and watched it.",9 October 2021

Morejambo54, Oh yeah yeah title,"Yeah this is a really enjoyable film. Is it anything that unique or incredible...kind of. The action definitely is. The action is by far the greatest part of the movie, damn does it look sick. The choreography is excellent, the fighting is so fluid, it's so fast paced and carries momentum throughout. All that is due to the vfx which are ofc good for such a high budget film. Now where I think the movie messed up a bit was the villain. The villain isn't bad per say but is just really bland and unoriginal, it actually gets really predictable towards the end. Also the ending is just absolutely crazy. Now don't get me wrong crazy is absolutely great for an over the top movie like this but it did take me out of the movie. The first section of the movie tho! AMAZING!

Mike_Devine, Surprisingly entertaining for MCU's 4th phase,"Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community. Despite having an unnecessarily long title, 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is a fun ride that doesn't feel like a retread of Marvel films past.The introduction to Shaun (Shang-Chi, portrayed by Simu Liu) is handled well, as the character is likable and feels like a good fit among the established members of S. H. I. E. L. D. Comic relief comes in the form of Awkwafina's Katy - sidekick to Shaun - and an atypical showing by Sir Ben Kingsley, while more serious performances are delivered by veteran actors Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Michelle Yeoh.As for the plot, it can almost be split in two, as the first and second halves of 'Shang-Chi' feel like completely different films. The first half is very unserious and comes off as a companion to the latest 'Spider-man' entries, whereas the second half is a more traditional Marvel action-drama. Even though there are plenty of typical superhero tropes thrown in here with even more of a Disney imprint than past MCU movies, it's still enjoyable for what it is.The somewhat surprising strength of 'Shang-Chi' suggests there's no slowing down in the MCU film factory.",14 November 2021

yaszi-83296," !Simple, beautiful and unique!","This movie was really different, it introduced some awesome characters with the awesome 10 Rings weapons, seeing them being used was cool, there are some great characters and the villain is great, the film looks beautiful and the effects are good, some people might say some of the magical looking stuff looks fake, but magic does not exist so I think a film writer or book writer should be able to show their own perception of magic.The film was pretty strait forward and simple, it didn't follow the same in a way, template as the other MCU movies but I like that, this movie introduced this great side to the MCU and I'm exited to see Shang-Chi's part in the MCU forwards.",10 November 2021
beanjaminmote, this movie sucks,"This movie was very disappointing. It was very poorly made and did not seem to be thought out at all. Which is why I was bewildered to find that this movie was so widely liked by the mcu fanbase, and was saddened to find even some of my friends liked the movie. I've seen this film be praised for its good characters, humor, fight scenes and storytelling. But I strongly disagree with almost all praise for this movie. I will admit there are some things to praise this movie for but whatever they are they are few and far between.This movie had some decent choreography for the fights, about a third of the fights were pleasing to the eye. However I only enjoyed 2 fights and that is only because the lead actor Simu Liu was the main focus of the fights. With Simu Liu background in martial arts he was able to do the fight choreography without the movie resorting to the overly zoomy and shaky camera with 5 cuts per movement that plagues most of the other mc movies. But sadly the rest of the fights are the typical marvel cutty fights or a gross mush of group fights with no discernible stakes.The main character actually had some good moments where I felt like he was a good person and he actually did not cause casualties in the double digits unlike most of the other recent ""heroes"". But he has no personality and all of his decisions make little sense. The bad guy has many of the same problems where they establish his character but then they make him do things against that character. Sadly there were no other characters that could carry them due to the fact that most of the characters in the movie were either soulless things with useless unfunny jokes or characters with exposition to shove down our throats, and only made decisions to move the plot onwards. This saddened me greatly because I rather like a lot of the actors in this movie.There were 2-3 jokes in the whole movie that I found even remotely funny. Besides those all the jokes were bad and lazy, usually ruining the mood of the scene or just carrying on for far too long. But due to the large amount of jokes and the little amount of comedic relief all of the ""funny"" characters seemed tasteless, unfunny and annoying.The story told was not inherently bad, It just had to rely on the hollow dialog to carry it along. And with most of the characters not really being expanded upon they seem to only be vesicles for this bad move to work.in all i did not enjoy watching this movie, i did however enjoy bashing on it with my friends and making fun of my ex-friends for liking it.",27 September 2021
moonracer0120, Philosophically something is missing,"Shang-Chi has great special effects and a compelling storyline but the script doesn't get too emotionally deep. This is one of the major liabilities of trying to tell a good story in about 2 hours. You simply can't because it takes time for viewers to develop care, concern, and emotional attachment to characters. So, what is best told in 2 hours? Robust short stories with excellent special effects that can only be enjoyed on the big screen. To this end Shang-Chi delivers in loads. The action is fast and the camera work while a bit dizzying captures the action very well. The only major issue I had with the plot is with the monsters that the heroes are fighting against. If you watch Chinese wuxia or xianxia dramas, you know that stories involving magical beasts are always based on Chinese mythology, Taoism, Buddhist, Chinese folk religion, traditional medicine, etc. Taoist immortals spouting what sounds like gibberish to laypeople is a classic character trope. The evil creatures that Shang-Chi fights against do not fit into the xiaxia genre world view. If they are demons no explanation is given for why they are so demonic? Have they been denounced by a bohisattva? Are they former immortals who failed to cultivate and somehow reincarnated into the hungry ghost realm? It may just be that wuxia and xianxia are so deeply developed (and this is obvious when you watch any popular Chinese historical drama--from ""Eternal Love"" ot ""Legend of Fuyao"") that deivating from these highly developed genres makes the film feel less ""Chinese"". While many elements of Shang-Chi resemble a Chinese fantasy drama the lack of proper wuxia and xianxia elements makes it feel like philosophically something is missing--at least from someone who watches a lot of these dramas on Rakuten Viki!",25 September 2021

bennemm-79490, This is as good as endgame,This movie is the best movie of all time. I've seen these reviews saying that the fighting is terrible and that the story is hard to follow but none of that is true the fights scenes where intense and the story was a work of art I can't wait to see what marvel do next with the eternals or any future production's. This is a 10/10 movie no matter what anyone says.,11 October 2021

mellynelloyos, Excellent,"All movies have flaws, but i really liked this movie and its very enjoyable. There is a lot more chinese dialogue that i thought there would be, which is amazing to me as a big budget hollywood film, but some of the translations were a bit off.Simu liu is very talented and likeable, the legendary hong kong superstar tony leung plays wen wu (aka the mandrin but he said it was made up by others), and meng'er zhang is amazing, even though xia ling was her first movie role. The action is one of the best things about this movie, especially the hand to hand combat.",15 October 2021

MiaMouse09, Absolutely stunning,"This movie completely blew me away! From the expression of Chinese culture to beautiful cinematography and a great plot, Shang-Chi has made it to my top 5 Marvel movies list. I loved that this movie has inspired so many young East Asian and Asian American children because they can finally see someone who looks like them as a superhero. Beautiful.I'm really looking forward to Eternals next as Marvel carries on including people of all ethnicities, genders, and sexual identities:)",28 October 2021
mikebalchaitis-50174, So much fun! Better action scenes than John Wick!,I loved it. I was very surprised. I had no expectations going in. Best fight scenes in an MCU movie so far. Surprisingly emotional for an Marvel movie. I loved the special effects. It was very funny but not as funny as the other movies. Looking forward to see Shang-Chi in the future.,13 November 2021
erikahawj-22103, It was more than I expected!,"As an Asian-American, I am no stranger to the cliche martial art scenes and corniness of it all. I went in fully expecting everything about this movie to be cheesy and cliche like Mulan was. Boy, was I wrong! Shang-Chi was so beautifully written, acted, and directed! I really want to give a huge shout out to the directors for their incorporation of Asian culture into this movie without making everything a cliche or a punch-line. I teared up watching people who looked like me be the main actors on a big screen and not the punch-line of a joke.Now, onto the story, the story was alright. It wasn't the best, but it's an introductory movie to the hero so not much to expect there other than your typical hero introductory tropes.The OST's of this movie were off the charts! I really enjoyed the music they had and think they nailed it.Need I say more about the acting? Tony Leung, Sima Liu, Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh...These are the best of the best for Asian American actors and they nailed every scene they had in the movie!Lastly, I absolutely loved the cinematography and the fight scenes. They were well thought out and choreographed. It didn't seem cheesy or corny. Thank you Marvel for making this movie and paying homage to Asian Americans. This movie will be one that I will never forget!",7 September 2021
MamadNobari97, Vey Nice,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. Not one bit is boring and the comedy is really good and appropriate and not cringey like some other Marvel movies.This is not an ""8"" 8 for me, but it's not a 7 either, more like 7.6 but then again, IMDb doesn't have half stars for some reasons.The fight choreography is amazing and this one has some of the best hand-to-hand action in Marvel. It kinda gets ridiculous in the end and you feel like it's not in the MCU, but MCU is already ridiculous so this is not that far-fetched.The acting of all of them was good especially the father.The ""villain"" is really relatable and well-written, even though I felt like we needed more time with him, this much is enough to make you actually feel and understand why he does what he does and is kinda not the bad guy.The story and characters could've used some more fleshing out, especially Shaun's sister.Story and characters might be cliché but they use those clichés well and make you care about these characters and that's the most important part. I just wish there was more showing and not telling.The CGI was not that good and it's really noticeable especially at the end. They should've worked on it more and polished it.Not using gore and cuss words because they want their movies to be PG-13 really hurts these movies, even though they can use at least one f word but for some reason they don't, I'm not saying that f word can make the movie better, but sometimes you need something more than ""dam"" for the scene to be more impactful. Also, doesn't actually showing most of the flashbacks make them more impactful? Why does the camera turn away from the ""death"" scenes that can make the movie better? This is why not showing a little bit of blood and gore hurts these movies, these movies keep pulling their punches back, and believe me no one cares if you used some more gruesome scenes. How are you gonna make a Deadpool 3 and Blade movie then?All in all, very enjoyable movie with good martial arts fights, characters, music choice, and a decent story. I might like it better when I see it a second time, but right now I'm kinda lukewarm about it. Really looking forward to seeing more of what Shang-Chi's gonna do in the MCU.",10 November 2021
fjknvcwq, This Movie was Terrific! Top Tier Marvel,"This movie has everything you'd expect from a top tier Marvel film. Great Action, Great Humor, Great Casting, Great Effects and a good story.People less likely to enjoy this movie:
1. DC fanboys, because it's easily better than ANYTHING the DCU has put out and they just hate that.2. Xenophobes, because 95% of the cast is Asian (obviously)3. Chauvinists, because it has several strong female characters4. MAGA, see 2&35. Comic book purists, because the characters and storylines don't follow the comic books to the extent they insist it should.If you don't fall into any of these categories.

silicontourist, A Marvel Of East West Cinematic Cultural Bonding...if only it were so in the real world!,"This was a case of 3rd time lucky for me; as I was totally disappointed with the dismal, 'GHOST IN THE SHELL' and the utterly abysmal 'SNAKE EYES' rubbish. Every single actor/actress/character played their roles to perfection and everything was in balance throughout i.e. Comedy timing, amount of CGI and an excellent script. My favourite Chinese lady actress (of whose films I have seen nearly all), Michelle Yeoh, is her usual perfect self.Everything that is good about the film has already been commented upon in most of the other reviews here so, all there is left to say is that its a great film for family, eastern fantasy and the toy that all the kids are going to beg parents for as a Christmas present (I won't say a name etc but when you get to the Ben Kingsley appearance part of the film, you will know of what I'm talking of).Top notch film and best of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) to date...after 'AVENGERS: ENDGAME (2019) of course.",16 November 2021
pearlcruzpickle, One of the top 3!,"Definitely one of the top 3 MCU films thus far. Right up there with Avenegers. And easily the best movie to come out of 2021.

timothyhilditch, Shang-Chi and the last dragon,"Another addition to the MCU, which is becoming more and more sci-fi every movie. This movie is the Asian one, taking inspiration from Chinese Mythology and Kung-Fu in this action-adventure. Great fight scenes and chases expertly shot, the downside is that most of it looks entirely computer generated. The comedian I don't like made me disappointed again, but once the 2nd comedic side kick joined it was a lot more funny. Strong start, middling middle and an ending which lacked motivation. If only it didn't get dragged into Asian Wakanda.",27 January 2022

The storyline was so terrible nothing special, no any plot twist and no emotional moment but stupid joke. Why they bring an old story line in any Chinese fitting movie and also include this too? So lame.Next, i don't know is this hollywood movie or Bollywood or a Korean TV series? You will see what happens in the first 15m the CGI was unbelievable fake, especially bus fight scene. Then the last fight scene so suck made me to leave the theater.Im an also an asian but I cannot accept this, they just want to slavery china and earning money.

Secondly, the cast is awesome, I really like Akwafina in her role, she is very funny. Also I like Simu Lu as main character he is charismatic person. But my favourite is one character from past film of MCU (don't want to give spoiler). Thirdly, I like how the atmosphere of ancient Chinese culture was shown, but for me I want more. Fourthly, the fighting is good too.So, it's nice MCU film.",3 November 2021
g-89622, Chinese culture goes to the world,"Marvel routine format, nothing special. There are many Chinese elements, many Chinese dialogues, good special effects, and some understanding of Chinese philosophy. It is a very good job in the European and American popcorn market. The founder wants to use ""mother tongue-Chinese"" in some key emotional processing, and in some rational or background explanations, ""English"" is used as much as possible to let the target audience understand the whole world view as soon as possible, and many trade-offs and efforts have been made. Of course, if you are looking forward to a deep understanding of Chinese culture, then you may be disappointed; But if, like me, you just hope not to be those stereotypes forever, you will see a lot of intention to go in the right direction.",15 November 2021
chupa-no-dedo, Marvel has nothing left to offer.,"Marvel has stopped trying and no longer wants to risk it. Why should they, when movies like this get all the praise.In the beginning, Shaun was actually likeable, but as the movie progresses, he just kinda does stuff and his motivations are almost inexistent. The rest of the characters are bland and uninteresting.The plot is all over the place and boring, filled with explanation after flashback after explanation, which makes it too long.The fight scenes start off good, but then they just become huge and filled with cgi, and that just makes it boring for me.In conclusion, this is a weekend movie to see with your family when it comes on tv, the kids will love it but the adults will forget it after 3 days. Just a generic tasteless movie.",11 September 2021
angeloacuna, One of the best hero origin story and movie,"It's simply of the best MCU origin story along with ironman, black panther, and Gotg, the character development was great, Cinematography was unique and definitely created a new style of scenery in the MCU, while the fight choreography blew my mind and it is by far the best fight sequence MCU has to offer since Winter soldier, and the CGI was top tier even though it's a martial arts movie it blended in perfectly, and the performances of the actors and actresses was on point, and having a good villain is not really common in the MCU but in this movie you will actually care for the villain and his backstory unlike most of the villains the MCU has produced, hence this is why I think it's one of the most iconic and one of the best hero origin story and movie out there.",5 September 2021
flschaumann, 1/3rd great action comedy 2/3rds cringy disneyesque cliche,"The first third of the movie is pretty good,a light hearted action flick with likable characters and good action scenes.The moment the actual plot gets going and they dive into the chinese fantasy CGI, though, the cringy cliche density becomes near unbearable. This is over the top in a way I´d usually only expect from a cheap early 90s Hong-Kong B movie.Unfortunately this movie took itself seriously while applying said style.Terrible movie that left a bad taste ....",11 November 2021
sebastianlohmann-52183, Glad to see asian heroes and actors sadly in a lackluster story,"The fights are good if you are a fan of the old kung fu movies, the story is pretty flat and basic the character development and motivations are very simple and boring, if it was 20 years ago and with no MCU it would have been fine, but there are so many better superhero movies, keep making diverse movies I would also like to see a sequel just make it good, make me care about the great action. The characters are underdeveloped and the story is just basic and overdone, they could have a great family conflict if they only made the villain more complicated and could have saved the whole ending.",13 November 2021
gwixumu, Very poor script,"The actors and choreographers are overshadowed by an incredibly poor script.Too many things are cliched, rushed or just generally bad.I found myself cringing at many parts in this film.What could have been a fantastic story of a son & daughter having to overcome the misguided grief of their father became a film full of misjudged moments, undeveloped characters and a cgi mess.",25 September 2021
karanmakwana-60127, Fantastic movie,My opinion is very legendary fight and super movie.,5 September 2021
cwkenreich," Not original, but still nicely executed","Let's face it, Shang-chi is pretty much Black Panther with an all Asian cast. I'm sure this sounds rather cynical but here me out: the first half of the film is a down-to-earth James Bond kind of film, then our protagonist reunited with his family halfway through and is transported to a fantasy world, only to have internal family conflicts drive the rest of the plot. Sound familiar? I'm in no way saying the two are parallels but this overarching story arc is becoming cliche. Black Widow was sort of guilty of this in a way, but was still unique in its own right, for better or for worse. In the case of Shang-Chi, the plot was extremely predictable. He would inevitably reunite with his family and battle his father. That didn't strip the film of all suspense, but Marvel screenwriting remains an Achilles heal.Wew! Now that I've got that out of the way, here's everything I loved about this movie: this has the GREATEST fight choreography of any Marvel movie Ever. There was this beautiful, majestic rhythm and flow to every single action scene that at many parts gave me literal goosebumps. For once, the CGI complimented the action beautifully without making me cringe. In a way it was like a remake of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. In addition, the acting was above average for a Marvel movie. The complex motivations of the hero and villain were realistically portrayed. Speaking of the villain, Xu Wenwu deserves a spot next to Thanos and Killmonger as one of Marvel's greatest antagonists. And compare to the snooze-fest that was Black Widow, the plot was flying as fast as a dragon. Finally, the cherry on top, Awkwafina and the hilarious comic-relief she infused into this whole story. Her style was really reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy. The film wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining without her.Overall, this definitely exceeded expectations (although they were pretty low after Black Widow). It's a pleasing popcorn movie with enough complexity and artistry to garner some awards. And for Marvel fans, it's clear Shang-Chi's existence in this universe is a game changer.",19 September 2021

The backstory is garbage, not only is it stupidly cheesy it was unbelievable. The style couldn't make up its mind, things clashed to often and seemed half-hazardly assembled. The sisters character was so unbelievable I came to wish she wasn't in it at all, though I thought she was one of the better actresses. Akwafina is so over used these days. It's like we have to use her for any Disney movie that has an Asian actress in it now. And she's not a very good actress.... Tony Leung...how can you mess up a movie with Tony in it?

shoobe01-1," Great, then became another MCU movie","For the first hour or so, I fully expected this to be one of my favorite movies of the year, rate it 9. Well done, and most of all believable. Yes, even the improbable fighting (the bus!!!!) worked because it was just well done, well acted.Awkwafina was amazing. Sure, she was her. If you hate her comedian character, you'll hate her here. But she's written perfectly, and fills the role of the plucky sidekick better than it's been done. This is what cringey Rob Schneider roles back in the 90s were seeking; an everyman with some snark to say ""now I don't even know what is going on"" and ground the film, force things to be explained to us.Then Ben Kingsley popped in from another movie entirely, with a role that was troublesome but also stupid, and pulled the big lever to make it a normal MCU last two acts. Long monologues to explain things. Some more flashbacks to tell us stuff we already pretty much understood, so rob the emotional payoff instead. Set up/train, then big fight. Yawn. Same old stuff, all very predictable, which is good as it's unwatchable, confusing.So disappointing how they totally lost their way with story and choreography at the end.",13 November 2021

papanloveu," One of the best ""literally""","Such an amazing film. Unlike some of the other marvel movies that imo try too hard to be cool or emotional and end up taking themselves way too seriously, Shang-Chi feels very organic in everything it does.

The visuals were absolutely stunning, comedic relief was always on point, fight sequences were sleek yet powerful. I had high hopes for Shang Chi and it absolutely delivered.

It's like those crazy ideas you think of, before realizing it's a little too chaotic. This movie does that, but makes it good and executable. The only thing I'd change about the movie is the VFX.

gcsman," ""Welcome to the circus""","It's always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production -- a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros. With Shang-Chi it looks like their Phase 4 is well and truly launched, and you can already glimpse what Marvel Studios' overall approach is going to be. (More below.)Just like Black Widow was Marvel's run at doing a James Bond-type film, Shang-Chi is their try at doing the Chinese martial arts thing. The result is a kind of compromise Westernized version that falls between two poles. For sure though, you'll be entertained. There's more than enough action, a lot of strikingly beautiful settings, and fun characters. But before I forget -- the mid-credits scene is one of the best they've ever done and totally worth staying for. (That's where the quote I put in the title above comes from -- a certain familiar character telling Shang-Chi to sure, come on in and join the craziness.) It does the usual thing of tossing the baton forward to whatever the next production will be, but it's stylistically so clever that it really stands out.And the film itself: it fills up its 2:12 runtime with a whole lot of material and a lot of characters. Maybe too much. The third act in particular veers off onto a fantasy-type track that doesn't entirely fit well with the previous hour and a half of setup, and the scenes in that last section suddenly feel more rushed. Gone are the days of the first Iron Man or Thor or Ant-Man movies with their lean, linear storylines and single well defined themes. Instead, Marvel now seems to want to overstuff every one of their productions, even if they involve 'secondary' MCU characters, and turn them into epics. More and bigger is not always better, is it?I did like the cast. Marvel always does an impressive job bringing in good people. Nice to see there are no less than 4 (!) major roles for females, as opposed to 2 for males, and they mix and match well. Of the mostly young cast though, I thought the older pair (Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh) really stood out -- they effortlessly dominate the screen when they are on. Leung's character could have been a stock, one-dimensional scenery-chewing villain, but he's much more nuanced than that. Simu Liu (the lead role, Shang-Chi) is not exactly a great actor just yet, but he's athletic and cute and attractive with a sense of humor and for this role he doesn't need to be much more than that. Awkwafina, as Katy, does her usual turn with comic relief and side commentary with a dash of romance. As for Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) -- that came out of nowhere and he's absolutely out of place, but somehow it works partly because of his pet that rises to Disney levels of cuteness.About Phase 4. The first three cycles introduced and used particular major characters that were all required to fit under the Avengers umbrella. Now it's the post-Avengers era and from their scheduled series of releases up through 2023, we'll see a much more diverse slate of characters and stories that don't obviously fall under a single umbrella. If they do have a Master Plan for something equivalent to the Avengers, it's hard to see what it is. Maybe, they'll use this new freedom just to show us interesting stories in a bigger universe.",11 September 2021

qayyimahmed," Great fun, would rewatch","I have seen almost every Marvel movie, and so far this is the only one I plan to rewatch. It's just a little bit of a shame Tony Leung's character dies so we won't be seeing him in the MCU anymore.",7 September 2021
parkerviale, A must see!,"This movie was highly anticipated and it held up to my expectations. As a massive Marvel fan, this movie had me fully engaged from start to finish. The fight sequences were amazing! They were very different from most movies, making them very unique. Every actor gave a wonderful performance as well. I'm not rating this one a 10/10 because of the dragon sequence towards the end. It was awesome at the start, but it seemed to drag out a bit too long. Still very entertaining though. Even if you're not a Marvel fan, I still highly recommend seeing this film. You don't need much Marvel background when seeing this one. Obviously, if you're a Marvel fan, you will for sure piece things together. Overall, Shang-Chi is a stunning film.",6 September 2021
carriepeterson-52165, Theater Worthy,"This movie was so well made. Of course it has your typical marvel magic, action, and comedy, but it's really fantastic. The build up, the dialogue, the action was all very moving. This is definitely worth seeing on the big screen.",8 September 2021
jonalovin-45307, Fun with great choreography and cgi,I'm a sucker for mythical creatures and fluid fight scenes; this movie had both. The two main characters were very likeable as well.This is basically a Marvel/Kung fu/fantasy mashup. It's not anything new but it IS a good time.,6 September 2021
WyattBe3, Finally! A Kung-Fu Film Made By Marvel Studios!,"How can I describe how much I love this movie?! I LOVED it! By far the best superhero movie of the year (until Spider-Man: No Way Home comes out).I grew up reading Marvel Comics (thanks Dad for the many visits to the local library). That's how I became a huge fan of Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, The Avengers, etc. And Shang-Chi was one of those comics I read growing up. I watched so many Bruce Lee movies and wished that he was still alive to have at least played Shang-Chi back in the day. But then I got my wish this year!I really enjoyed the story of this film and it gives the backstory of the Ten Rings organization, as depicted first in 2008's Iron Man. Tony Yeong was amazing as Wenwu, the OG Mandarin in the comics. He was just a father that wanted to reunite with his family and bring back his dead wife to be a family again. And I loved Simu Liu as Shang-Chi. He bodied the character very well and I loved the banter between him and Awkwafina's character. I thought Awkwafina was gonna be annoying at first, but then I grew to love her character. I'm happy that Shang-Chi and Katy weren't love interests in this one, but I don't mind if we see them as a couple in the next one (and there will definitely be a next Shang-Chi film). It was a surprise that I get to see Abomination back in his true comic accurate form! And Wong fighting him?! Come on, that's awesome! Ben Kingsley was a surprise to see. I loved him in this more than when he was ""acting"" as the Mandarin in Iron Man 3. I really liked Shang-Chi's sister, Xialing, who is a badass by the way. I loved the story and the characters and oh my God, the score and visuals was stunning!I loved the choreography of the many styles of Kung-Fu. The fighting was just spot on from what I've seen watching the Bruce Lee films. And I got to admit, Wenwu was an amazing villain. I put him up there with Thanos, Killmonger, Loki, Mysterio, Vulture, Red Skull and Ego the Living Planet.Overall, I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings a solid 10/10.",14 November 2021
katimcbride, Beautiful Film - just as many laughs as there were tears,"I found this story to be incredibly moving and I absolutely loved the story. My partner and I spent the entire ride home comparing notes and gushing about the acting. Anyone who says ""the acting is ok"" is using that BS to support their overall dislike for the film *or* they've recently changed their meds. I was surprised at how well Awkwafina's character fit into it all. She was an anchor for the main character to the life he ran away to. She had purpose - especially in the end.They all had great character development and I loved the story. The antagonist killed it and he just layers upon layers. The main characters acting was outstanding.I cried through a lot of this film. At several points I asked myself why the hell I was crying so much (wait... did I recently change meds?!). Maybe it's the family loss that hit home. They brought in other characters from the MCU and it was nice seeing so many other movies threaded into this.I'm surprised at anything less than 7 stars. This film was great entertainment and I'll be first in line for the sequel.",24 September 2021
elliotpower2000, Surprisingly good!,"Going in to watching shang chi the legend of the ten rings I was apprehensive and didn't think that this was the right way for the mcu to go however after watching it I am happily proven wrong!

drjlamarche, Great action but bad acting,"The martial arts in the movie were amazing and so fun to watch. The plot was decent and flowed nicely. I felt like it was a little long and also I didn't feel like it was connected to the MCU. I supposed it'll all come together at some point because as we know Marvel never misses a beat. My biggest criticism was the acting, especially from Awkwafina. Her acting is awful. Overacting throughout the entire movie. I didn't find her funny at all, although she was placed in the movie as comic relief. Totally flopped. And of course, she has to be the character that has no fighting experience whatsoever but ends up helping save the day. Ridiculous. Overall a good movie but not in Marvel's top 10.",8 September 2021

jagesara, What Marvel does best,"Review of ""SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE 10 RINGS"". The newest from Marvel and what a sensational one ! Technical fight-scenes, strong Martial Arts/Kung Fu, lots of humor, elegant moves and original language. Our main hero and heroine are Chinese, so we can expect some traditional karaoke scenes and perhaps a dragon or two. Based on one of the Marvel Comics, let's leave it to that, there's no need to compare the book with the film. Just enjoy both.The story itself is a classic love story, the things we do for Love. But as always we have the battle between good or bad and the grey area in between. Whoever owns the 10 rings will be the master of his fate. Invincible and troubled at the same time. Power comes with responsibility.This must be the 12th time for me to fall in love with Tony Leung, all over again. Such a charismatic actor (from the film ""In the mood for love"") as always intense and charming. His intriguing smile is a trigger to be more careful. It's an exclusive quality. Is he serious or are you the next victim? No doubt, he's always in control of every character he plays. Here, he's the badass, Xu Wenwu, with a big lust for power and he has the 10 rings to help him achieve this never ending hunger for more. But there's more to him than just being strong headed and bold. When he meets his opponent, a female force so overwhelming , it awakens tenderness and modesty in our villain. That's how you win, use the yin-yang, it works every time. There's more to Life than just battle and gaining power. Victory has many shades and combined with Love, Life becomes paradise. However, this is a huge action movie, so brace yourself for lots of twists in the storyline, with surprising animals and hidden secrets in some people's hearts. They are all fighting an inner-battle, holding grudges and making the same mistakes every time. Why are they hurting inside? We have to look at the ghosts from the past , because ""you can't outrun who you really are''. And that's the centre of all the action. Our hero Chang/Shaun has a troubled journey ahead, becoming himself, restoring his given powers, reconciling the past with the present in order to obtain the balance of the world. And that's exactly what Marvel does best !! With beautiful fight-scenes, all fully orchestrated with calculated blows and kicks, such graceful, exquisite and delicate moves. Like a perfect dance. And who else than Michelle Yeoh, our Martial Arts-diva (from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon '') who has elevated her profession to an allround level. It's such a pleasure to watch her in fight-scenes, she has an elegant and experienced style. New star on the horizon is the other fighter Xia Ling, she has the badass attitude, it comes natural to her. She delivered great action.The women fighters are equally blessed with skills (usually in chinese historical drama), with the exception of Awkwafina (plays Shaun's pengyou/friend), she has other know-how and she's good at it. So no need to compare, if you put all efforts together, there might be a chance to defeat the enemy.Tony Leung has such an important character here, his acting is quite impressive and in a pleasant way he takes the limelight from our hero, who seems okay with it. Not sure it's because of the storyline, or his status, or even his image on the poster. He's literally the boss there. That's probably the power of the 10 rings, whoever wears them will rule the world. But beware of jealous competition and deceit in the name of Love. Even in the Marvel Universe rings are magical, centred around great powers and endless possibilities. They are worth living or dying for. All in all, a very interesting and action packed movie. Very entertaining, very smashing/thrashing and a very good one for a date-night. Or see it with your friends/family. Enjoy the ride ! MUST SEE !!",19 September 2021
pavan116, Sky High!,"Seriusly !I didn't even expected much from this movie.I lost intrest in MCU after END-GAME , I only watch phase-4 MCU just for the sake of continuation , but not whole-heartedly.But when i saw this kickass movie , goosebumps ! Lit 🔥

screamyever, Great Start... but...,"...getting more and more boring, childish and too much ""over-the-top-Fantasy"" with time.It starts as a great martial arts movie, with humor, good acting, great fight and action scenes.But in the second half of the movie it loses its humor. I got bored several times and the fantasy is just getting too much. It turns to a children's movie. I was so bored and annoyed of this bad twist that I almost didn't finish the movie. It lost me completely. What a pity!First half: 10/10

musikonpr, Excelent!,Great action and aventure movie. Easily one of the best MCU movies and that is a lot to say.,5 September 2021
redcanofevil, A 2hr Product Placement,"Shang-Chi is at its core a product placement for the Chinese market without any vision or necessity to exist. Extremely poorly directed and poorly written movie that failed to balance its tone for the entirety of its runtime. A poorly shot low budget attempt to imitate Martial Arts movies of the past devoid of any soul, compelling characters or even good action. Ridiculous random radio music selection that makes no sense and a plot although not the worst was easily one of the biggest wasted potentials in the MCU thus far. The movie was a disservice to Shang-Chi, The Mandarin and the Rings itself. A movie without a shred of respect for the comics that inspired it instead focuses on how to make the Chinese market happy and not ban it. Easily the worst MCU movie till now by quite a margin.RATING: 4.5/10.",16 November 2021

jordyntsmith, Martial Arts and MCU,"Effectively an origin story for Shang-Chi that marries the styles of superhero and martial art films wonderfully, and adds some much needed intrigue back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).I did legitimately enjoy the movie! It tries new things and is one of the more enjoyable MCU films. However, it did not quote tip the scale into becoming one of the best MCU movies in my opinion. At times, it felt a little too fantastical for my liking (especially the third act).The story, visuals, and characters are all pretty great! But I find the film mostly suffered from an ending that could have been more grounded in reality than it was. I am happy though, to see Shang-Chi added into the MCU.",11 September 2021

The story is ok but pretty predictable. Ben Kingsleys appearance is fun. The only reason I'm giving this a 6 is the CGI is laughably bad. For Disney/Marvel to have CG that look like they are from another film Ben Kingsley starred in, A Sound of Thunder, is just pathetic. Completely took me out of the film in the second half.

sarathparutan, A Unique Twist in the MCU,"The cast, the costumes, the setting! To me, in my opinion (despite the few plot holes here and there) was already detailed enough. The action sequence was good. And the CGI, wow! You should see it for yourself when you get to watch that part. I rather be careful reviewing this because I don't really want to give away any spoilers. So forgive me if I wouldn't put much detail. I can only say that I went to the cinema not expecting so much, but in the end, I actually enjoyed it! So I recommend to give this movie a chance and watch it!",2 September 2021
altisanishah, formulaic,"Nothing new. Typical storyline, weak and all too familiar coupled with some bad dialogues, and that all was drowned out by the special effects galore. Yeah, the cgi takes center stage...well, almost the whole stage.The casting doesn't quite work for me except for Tony Leung, he was great. Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh and the village leader were there to sell tickets. They were unnecessary big names in small roles that could have been filled with lesser names. The main roles however...could have been better. Simu Liu and Awkfina lack the star power, the attraction, the draw.Was this a bad movie though? Not really, it was entertaining enough although I lost interest somewhere near the hour mark. It was already obvious by then how the story will unfold. Could have been much better.",25 November 2021

As many marvel/mcu films has the good and the bad.The good: The most remarkable factor was the coreography from the action/fight sequences, very fluid and not exagerated.The soundtrack was another amazing factor, we are talking of a mixture of cultures (i really felt Black Panther vibes on this one) that can engage all the marvel and non marvel fans out there.Regards of the plot, this one was very emotional and with lot of heart and power.The cgi effects was on point (which was my biggest fear and sometimes a let down on other mcu films)The bad:
Shang chi, along side of the cast lacks of good and reliable acting which with combining with the signature forced jokes was little annoying to see.Althought the plot was simple, this was a little predictable, but overall enjoyable.Final thoughts: Despite of the forced acting, A must watch movie that definitely will engage the audience with all its assets.",21 September 2021

xialing, Bringing up MCU to new world,"POSITIVE
-great Casting (SImu Liu, Tony Lueng). Especially Tony Lueng because he look badass and has great acting skill.-You've already heard people praising the film's action choreography, and it's well-deserved. It doesn't has many cut scenes like many MCU fighting scenes.-This film felt completely unique from what we've seen from the MCU already.-Props to the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack as well, they were great!-The first two act was incredible and amazing showing the life of Shang-Chi, how Wenwu meet his wife etc. This type of act is something MCU usually doesn't have.-This film open up MCU to new world with myth creature, many evil organization, and the mystery of the Ten Rings.NEGATIVE
-The casting was STELLAR. Aside from the one person I didn't care for (*Razor Fist, cough cough*) everybody played their roles to perfection.-The jokes may not be funny to some people. But It's funny to me.-The only issue I had with Shang-Chi was the third act. Not that it was bad, but it felt detracting from what the first 2/3rds of the movie established. It become every MCU logic part(CGI BATTLE). It took away from the great hand-to-hand action stunt work, but it's to be expected from a film of this genre.The exposition can be a bit heavy but understandably needed to introduce a brand newcharacter into this universe.IMO
Great way to introduce new hero. Great Martial art fight scenes. Great characters. Looking forward to Shang-Chi. Also Wenwu.Not a Top Tier Film in Movie Industry but A Top Tier Film in MCU STANDALONE movies.",3 September 2021
soniccpown, Boring!!!,"This movie is rated way too high for what it's worth. It's all too predictable in a negative way, too boring characters, too boring story, too little action and too bad! Everyone should watch the movie for themselves but don't fully believe in the high reviews!",20 December 2021
cappiethadog, Woman of the sun,"Masaki Kobayashi was a pacifist. The celebrated Japanese filmmaker, best-known for ""The Human Condition"", took the unusual and daring position of denouncing his country's military actions during WWII. Somehow, Kobayashi got ""The Thick-Walled Room"" financed, and pushed it past the censors, even though it broached the largely taboo subject of war crimes. Set in an American detention center, war veterans express guilt and remorse, and most importantly, hold themselves accountable for their actions. ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", directed by Dustin Daniel Cretton, is evocative of Kobayashi's ideology circumlocutorily by referencing ""Kwaidan"", in particular, ""The Woman of the Snow"", the second in a quartet of ghost stories, which was the filmmaker's only foray into genre; the horror movie. Xu Wenwen(Tony Leung), aka ""The Mandarin"", a warmonger blessed with everlasting life, learns the whereabouts of Ta Lo, a village secreted away behind thick foliage. It's people know how to fight like gods. Surviving the ambulatory trees that claim the Xu's discovery party, he encounters Li(Fala Chen), the divine martial arts' most experienced practitioner, his future wife, in what can only be described as a grindhouse meet-cute. Whereas The Mandarin harnesses his power through the ten rings, Li only needs her bare hands to win the battle with relative ease. Without the ten rings(nunchucks being its closest analogue), The Mandarin is no Bruce Lee, whose hands they say, as the legend goes, were unregistered lethal weapons. Inexplicably, Li falls in love with this psychopath, whose penchant for violence rivals The Joker.From ""Kwaidan"", for starters, the filmmaker, having the advantage of CGI in his tool kit, draws out the plant life's malevolent subtext, in which its lunging movement towards the two woodcutters, caught in a terrible snowstorm, seems not only a condition of the wild winds, but an innate cognition to do them bodily harm. The trees are sitting ducks. The trees can't defend themselves from the woodcutters' axes. They're lives are dependent on the Woman of the Snow, a glacial apparition whose arctic breath entombs men in ice. The ""Yuki-Onna""(Keiko Kishi) blows on Mosaku(Jun Hamamura), one of the woodcutters, as he sleeps in an abandoned hut. It's a superpower that any villain in the Marvel universe would regard with a modicum of awe. The surviving woodcutter witnesses the older man's killing and expects the same ignominious end-result. But when the woman gets a closer look at Minokichi(Tatsuya Nakadai), she is smitten, indicated by an elusive smile, and ends up citing his handsomeness and youth as reasons for her charity. Clearly, the woman of the snow is lonely, her Achilles heel; the ultimate cougar, who must be at least a thousand-plus years his senior. In ""Shang Chi"", it's more clear-cut that Li is abdicating her duty to defend Ta Lo from potential marauders, choosing personal happiness over communal obligation. Harder to glean, but not too hard, Yuki-Onna also has deep-seated commitments. A sort of Mother Nature, but militant, her job is to fend off those who wish to shorten the lives of flora and fauna; she's a warrior for the natural world. Trees will fell unchallenged by the axes of future woodcutters, similar to how the Tai Lo villagers die in war waged by Wen-Wu and his army. Each respective woman chose love over duty; a domestic life, husband and children, over their calling.To both Shang Chi(Simu Liu) and Xialing(Meng-er Zhang), son and daughter, Li bequeaths her sired ones a green emerald pendant that even through adulthood, never leave their necks; these precious gemstones handed down from their deceased mother, refashioned into bling. Green, coincidence or not, is the same color as the crystal which guides young Clark Kent(Jeff East) to the farthest reaches of the north, in Richard Lester's ""Superman"", where the Krypton-based jewel initiates construction on the Fortress of Solitude, Superman's man cave. Both women, Li and Yuki-Onna inhabited fortress solitudes of their own, a village cut off from mainland China and rural Japan, respectively. Even Superman chooses Lois Lane(Margot Kidder) over being earth's champion, when he exposes himself to the red sunlight of his home planet, which strips him of his superpowers. Nobody wants to be alone, not even the Man of Steel. Quite understandably, Li, being a responsible custodian, leaves her magic back in Tai Lo, not even trusting her husband with god-level Kung Fu. The ten rings, on the other hand, could be put to good use, but reappropriating the weapon into a tool to protect mankind isn't in his nature. All he can do is store them away in a desk drawer, neutralizing its awesome power, in the interim. The Mandarin could be a potential superhero, but his reformation is conditional; it's contingent on romantic love, not brotherly love. There are limits to love. He can only be a retired foe to earth, not its friend. Because of this, Li keeps secret from her husband the purport of those emeralds, which are actually emblematic eyes of a mechanized statue, not mere heirlooms passed down from parent to child, in which its niche as performative dragon eyes radiate water held in suspension long enough to yield a map that directs The Mandarin to Tai Lo. The mother played no favorites, whereas Jor-El(Marlon Brando) provided no duplicate green crystal for Kara(Helen Slater), Superman's female cousin, in Jeannot Szwarc's ""Supergirl"". Ta Lo is a country within a country. Growing up without a mother, Xialing, saddled with a father who abided by the unyielding tradition of China's patriarchal strictures put on women, she could just watch in secrecy as Shang-Chi, training to be an assassin, fought alongside the men; a boy among men, shadowing his every move. That's China. As the forgotten daughter, waiting for her father to show up, Jiang Nan(Michelle Yeoh), to Xiangling's surprise, is informed that men and women train and fight like egalitarians. That's not China; that's a Chinese utopia. Shang-Li, previously attacked stateside, in which his cover as a underachiever is blown, when the car valet reveals himself to be Bruce Lee incarnate on a moving bus, to the amazement of Katy(Awkwafina), his childhood friend, disposing all-comers with exceptional ease. Under attack again, this time in his home country, once again he faces the same gang, this time, joined by Xiangling, at a fight club, an enterprise she built from scratch, it goes unsaid, to earn her father's love after leaving home as a lost sixteen-year-old girl. Just as Shang-Li is about to put the finishing touch on his old trainer, identifiable by a fancy yellow and black mask. The father uses the ten rings to stop Shang-Chi. It's a strange reunion. With paternal love, Mandarin admits that he put a hit on Shang-Chi. But like a proud papa, he knew that his assassin training would, more likely than not, stave off annihilation, and is overjoyed that he was right. Nothing personal, he just wanted the pendant. The same hit is put on Xiangling, but in the absence of a similar heart-to-heart talk, the father implies an indifference to his daughter's life. The father has enough love for just one child.An actor lives under their father's roof; an actor who once impersonated Mandarin, as a decoy for Aldrich Killian(Guy Pearce), a terrorist, in Shane Black's ""Iron Man 3"". Trevor Slattery(Ben Kingsley), this time, has no role to play; his Fu Manchu beard is gone. He plays himself. On the surface, Trevor Slattery's appearance can seem contrived, because otherwise, ""Shang Chi"" would be a stand-alone movie, untethered from the Marvel Universe. Duly noted, by countless film theorists, no doubt, Kingsley is sending-up..., who some believe was impersonating...in the network television series ""Kung Fu"". Lee, however, did star in ""The Green Hornet"", playing Kato, a sidekick to the titular star. It's ""The Green Hornet""(green, the same color as the emerald pendants), not ""Kung Fu"", that's explicitly referenced in ""Shang-Chi"", especially when Xiangling instigates an escape from her father's compound by literally breaking down a wall. In the getaway car, Slattery sits shotgun; he doesn't get to be the hero. Katy drives. Brother and sister, the superheroes, sit in the back like VIPs. Slattery is the sidekick, not to the hero like Kato was, but to the hero's best friend. Quite pointedly, in Tai Lo, the film simultaneously tweaks, but also rejects the Hollywood trope of... The native people fight their own battles. When Razor Fist(Florian Monteau), whose right hand is a machete blade, fight with the villagers, he's an equal, not a savior, and also, it's the prudent choice. They have a common enemy, a demonic beast with tentacles of behemoth proportions. Meanwhile, as both sides combine forces to stop this hellacious creature from being let loose into the outside world, Slattery plays dead, in an act of character arc subversion. He's just a coward. Whereas in ""Enter the Dragon"", the hero saves his country, in ""Shang-Chi"", the hero saves the world.Her smile is genuine. The woman of the snow looks like a natural born domestic. The perfect wife and mother. She smiles with pride at the woodcutter's cleverness, making new sandals for her and their three children. She tries them on. It's a perfect fit. The betrayal is complete; she wears the wood from murdered trees. She returns to her sewing. And then, like something out of an inverted ""Vertigo"", Minokichi, seeing his wife barefoot again, perhaps, the woman of the snow comes back into the woodcutter's life, a ghost from the past. Being recognized, Yuki returns to the woods feeling great shame about the unspoken vow of chastity she broke by being involved with the trees' enemy, a woodcutter. It was real love, though. Yuki keeps the sandals.What about Li? Did she really love The Mandarin, or did she love mankind, marrying him to protect earth from the awesome power of the ten rings.",14 October 2021
newcinema2021, New Marvel Movies Feel Too Similar,"Seems like DC will be the king (again), because after No Way Home, they have literally nothing to care about. I used to like both, but right now DC seems to be so much more creative with doing all kinds of different movies. For example compare how extremely different are Joker and Suicide Squad, but both are great in their own way. But in Marvel, every movie feels exactly the same. Same meh effects, generic villains and cringe jokes.",4 September 2021
roganoffeski, Probably the weakest MCU movie since Iron Man 3,"I usually like to post my thoughts straight after seeing something new, either good or bad, but this time I just didn't care enough to bother. I just felt flat at the end. I'm sure there are plenty who enjoyed it, but the plethora of super high scores is weird. Even if you want to turn your brain off and enjoy the visuals, it's still not that good. It's actually quite dull.The acting is... fine. With the exception of some of Liu's scenes, the whole movie's had a complete charisma bypass. And then there's Awkwafina's performance - not as bad as I expected, but that was still some strange casting.Who knows, if they'd chopped half an hour and tightened up the story a bit, it might have worked better. But instead it was a bloated, CGI heavy snorefest. Unless Eternals is a surprise hit, I'm really not liking where the MCU is heading post-Endgame.",4 October 2021
ddiegel-76681, Bad movie with good visuals,"The action scenes are cool, Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley were funny, and there's some great CGI. Everything else about the movie was mediocre, at best.",5 September 2021
dobri_anim, A TERRIBLE SECOND VIEW EXPERIENCE,"Was absolutely painful to watch it second time. Where to start from...
Every single character's move, line and story twist-n-turn was annoyingly predictable than ever. So unpleasantly unsurprising. Acting was tagged, a total cliché. Not a single try or aiming to be more original than the first viewing, means no creativity. The humor was irritating. The action scenes were less exciting than watching a parody of Swan Lake at the local school. Camera work, if there was anything like ""work"", felt like they have tied up a half broken
camera on a limping mule's back, and have left. Editing is most atrocious: shot transitions felt long, even and boring, seems they've forgot to buy themselves a watch. Sequences have lost every meaning in the world they might have had in the first place. The soundtrack couldn't have been more inappropriate and insipid. .....
Expecting to like it? Don't watch it twice. Not even once.",18 January 2022
jamesinswansea, Boring and generic,Marvel was at its peak during the Endgame phase now were at a point where Marvel is trying to produce anything that looks like a super hero into a movie or TV series.This should have been an exciting film and there is nothing wrong the cast but to be honest this film is a snooze fest. It is so long and drawn out I found myself looking at the time to see when it was actually finished. The main problem with this film is is tries to hard.,26 December 2021
thebrettodonnell-95942, A disappointing frustration.,"Shang chi had so much potential only to be squandered by a sloppy, at times redundant screenplay that the cast largely struggle to elevate into something believable. Apart from the siste and the always great tony leung, the leads and even some side characters lack any kimd of real characterization or charisma, making the 2 hr run time (inflated by meandering scenes instead of any character development) feel more brutal than the sanitized martial arts in the movie.",18 November 2021
harrisonfunyc, Eye candy,Amazing REAL action. Not sure if actor simu liu knows martial arts at all but his fighting scene surely makes it look like he's a possessed martial artist. Funny & beautiful.

ongwillis, Overrated Asian Epic!!,"This film is only great of its visual, just like any other marvel films. Plot and the actors are boring, even the Marvel miniseries were way better than this crap. All the high ratings are most probably done by asians!! They just want their asian faces to be highly rated. Even the lead actor were pushing Marvel to do an asian superhero, my questions is why only the chinese, korean, japanese are considered as asians? Why cant be the indians, indonesians, mongolian or country like Kuwait and others be main lead as asians?",7 September 2021
a_gma, Worst Marvel movie by far,"This movie deserves my first IMDB review. I usually agree with critics and IMDB ratings, but this is ridiculous. Everything is so bad that I can't choose the worst part. I never had high expectations, but man, this sets the new low.The characters, the acting, the dialogs, the CG, the monsters, the machete guy, the soundtrack, the costume, the design, the jokes, the ""cute"" animals, the MCU references, the bad guys, the good guys, the ""love"" story, the whole family drama, I can keep going... I think that even if all the problems described were fixed, the movie would still be bad because the story is completely nonsense. Unfortunately, it's a compilation of bad decisions.If you were involved in the creation of this movie, my apologies. Good luck next time!TL;DR - Don't waste your time, it's terrible.

I mean the first guardians of the galaxy had the perfect joke/serious mix in my opinion but this movie was constantly making me cringe and uncomfortable. The CGI was great but that is pretty much the only positive side of this movie in my opinion... In terms of story I was surprised there was no deeper background on where the rings actually came from, I'm not saying it needs to be in the movie but just something I missed.I noticed a lot of people enjoyed this movie when I was in the theaters, so I am happy a lot of people actually enjoyed this movie.

Master_Strange, Marvel's Phase 4 continues to raise the bar!,"The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts. Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on. Highly recommended. A must watch.

The fight scenes were OK, but Katy, one of the main characters, tried too hard to be funny (and wasn't.) She was the most annoying MCU character I've ever seen.I'm not Asian, but I felt very uncomfortable with the not so subtle jabs at the Asian-American culture vs ancient Chinese one. The main characters seemed to ""Whitewashed"" to be taken as Asian heros.I did enjoy the AMC Dolby Atmos technology though.",25 September 2021

I feel kinda lacking at building villain character through the whole movie. And I still can't believe how they introduced Ten Rings origin so bad. Come on Marvel, I know you can do better.

timhayes-1, Breathtaking,"Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is quite frankly my favourite Marvel movie since the original Iron Man. While many fans check out or get excited for a new Marvel movie simply because they like the series, I was stoked for this one because my cousin Gene Day worked as an artist on the comic book series that this is based on Master of Kung Fu. He was and artist on the series from issue 76-120 and co-created the character of Death Dealer who features in this movie. I had high expectations for this film because of my family connection and it didn't disappoint. Stunning visuals and exciting stunts elevate this film. While there are chanes from the original comics, these changes make sense and still fit within the overall scheme of the Marvel universe. Shang-Chi's father in the originals was Fu Manchu but since Marvel no longer owns the rights to the character, it makes sense to pick another strong Asian villain like The Mandarin to take his place. Overall a great addition to the Marvel universe.",3 April 2022
ian-dodkins, Visually beautiful but dull story,"One of those films you feel they spent lots of money on except for the writing. If Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a ming vase, this is a red plastic cup. Has all the superficial concept of being 'chinese' without any subtelty. Basically a story for kids with nothing original. Shame cos the actors were good and it was almost but not quite a fun film. I could have written a better story when I was 10 years old. Anyway, kids will love it, adults probably just be happy that their kids are quiet for the duration. I guess it fits into the superhero mold of films that are all coming out now, but I'm finding these increasingly 2 dimensional and shallow. Is it worth watching. No, unless you are 10 yrs old.",9 December 2021

jenckell, Wow finally something innovative and new,"The physical raw fighting sequences alone turns you into a giddy kid glued to the screen hyper focused to not miss a single beat. Consensus: You will miss almost all beats cos the fighting is that fast and you wont be able to catch them all even if you could pause and rewind.I miss these type of movies focusing more on the physical aspect of fighting turning it into an art-form, and more of a struggle to force the character to master the skill in perfection before attempting to use it. The result of failure in physical fights are more deadly and the stakes are higher.Surprisingly, this move had a lot of soul I missed from other older similar movies and a rich landscape of interesting characters and creatures. This movie also had a splendid cast attached with some bad-ass women who got to fight a fair amount themselves which I loved. Great watch.

arshdeep-61438, How Shang Chi is Disney's way of uniting the world,"How Shang Chi is Disney's way of uniting the world
I had heard that the movie was mediocre and was originally apprehensive, but went ahead with it after one of my friends said that he enjoyed it. I would have missed it, had it not been for the chance encounter with Anushka (as I had not gotten my protein at the Fitness Park stall)I am glad I took his advice and met her.The movie has a storyline that is believable with the motivations of the villain very realistic. The poor guy only wanted to relive his glory days with his family (kind of like the kingpin in ""Spiderman-Into the Spiderverse""). He was holding on to the emotion for longer than intended. Tony Leung is a spectacular actor and portrays an immense amount of emotion through his eyes. It was a pleasure to watch his scenes
Awkwafina breathes happiness into every scene that she is a part of.Michel Yeoh really shows to us what a mature actor looks like.But the one who takes the cake is Ben Kingsley. His scenes, especially the one where he describes his motivation for becoming an actor are gold.Maybe a movie on an Indian Marvel superhero off the comics Paras Gavaskar (the Jain mutant who practices non-violence but want to stop evil), Dinesh Deol (an engineer capable of psychokinesis) or Paras Gavaskar, Shakti Haddad (the brilliant expert in genetics who can locate mutants, and manipulate nervous systems) is not too far.",19 October 2021

worldsworstwryter, So Close!,"Ooh I really want to love this one, and I did really enjoy it, but I think there was just a couple of things that could've been better!Firstly, the emotional parts of the film were great, and Tony Leung was absolutely brilliant, probably the best actor in the whole movie. The action was mostly good, and the creature designs in the village were charming and loveable. I also really enjoyed the return of Ben Kingsley and thought he was one of the highlights.However, during the first part half hour or so, the humour didn't land for me, and it felt rather forced. Thankfully though, this peters out in the second act onwards so it's not too big of a problem.Also, the action, while clearly well done and impressive, would've benefitted from a little less camera shake, which sometimes blocks the view of some awesome moves. One fight in particular stood out as beautifully shot, and we could clearly see the whole thing, I just wish they'd all been like that!Finally, I think that the stakes should've been dramatically lowered for the climax. The world has almost ended so many times in the Marvel Universe, that it's starting to lose it's impact. The same thing applies to the CGI and magic powers. Does everyone's power need to have glowing lights and CGI involved? Is it not fine to just fight with a cool stick? Does it really have to be a glowy red stick? I know that's a massive nitpick, but I think that taking some of the CGI away would've fit better with the movie, especially with the rings, which I thought really didn't mesh well with the visuals and style of the film. They were pretty much just energy blasters like 1000's of other Marvel powers, which was kind of disappointing.It sounds like I've got a lot of complaints about the movie, but I really did like it a lot. I'm only disappointed by these things, because this is a movie that has a lot of aspects I really really love, and I think would've been one of my favourites if it wasn't for these tiny little issues!Overall though, I did think this was a really fun movie with some fantastic performances, an enjoyable story, and some awe-inspiring scenery. I would definitely recommend it!",7 April 2022
drwbonfield, like a feature length episode of Power Rangers,This film is a load of nonsense.

Starring MCU newcomers Simu Liu as the titular character and Tony Leung as 'Wenwu' and, at last, the definitive portrayal of 'The Mandarin'. Helmed by director Destin Daniel Cretton this picture injects the perfect amount of Asian culture into this enormous franchise.The cast is stellar, especially Liu who wished this role into existence years ago on social media and I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. He has brilliant on screen chemistry with co-star Awkwafina who plays 'Katy', Shang-Chi's best friend. Katy acts as the audiences lens into this world. She is just a normal person and I feel her role is pivotal in helping general audiences digest a story with this many magical elements. Thanks to Leung's performance 'Wenwu' has become one of the best MCU villains. He is the excellent blend of menacing and sympathetic with understandable motives.The fight choreography is second to none in the MCU. They linked perfectly with the set pieces created for this film. They were excellent, in particular the Bus fight scene and the final fight between Wenwu and Shang-Chi. These brilliant pieces of action were achieved through the lack of camera cuts and smooth camera movements to exhibit the skilled choreography. Along with the set pieces, the overall look of this film is stunning. There are some especially beautiful shots within the final fight scene which makes up for some of the routine Marvel tropes which this picture eventually falls into.The main themes of family and grief are incredibly heartfelt. They're told expertly through these characters and are deeply rooted in Asian culture, something this film showcases with perfection. From the Ten Rings compound to the Golden Daggers Club in Macau to the fictional land of Ta Lo, the Asian culture is always on show and this film, along with the wider MCU, benefits from it tenfold.However, this film is not as perfect as it could've been, thanks in large part to the Marvel formula which this picture falls into like many of it's predecessors. This is most apparent in the 3rd act which not only drags on for too long, but also turns into big CGI monster vs big CGI monster once again. When I believe a more grounded martial-arts style fight would've been more fitting.Overall, 'Shang-Chi' began as a breath of fresh air into this franchise, with deeply rooted themes, a gargantuan cast and stunning fight choreography until it gave in to the ordinary marvel formula which has plagued this genre since it's inception. Despite this, the future looks bright for these characters and the post-credit scene cements the titular character as an MCU mainstay for years to come.8.5/10.",13 September 2021
ingvardtheterrible, Now my favorite Marvel movie,"Can't wait to see more of this part of the Marvel universe, especially Awkwafina. Her and Florence Pugh are my new, all-time favorite side characters. Oh, and Hailey Steinfeld/Kate Bishop. Excited to see more colorful, bad-a$$ women in the MCU!",27 February 2022
fajarsantoso, Martial arts with a Marvel Touch,"I love the story and the martial arts. This is definitely one of the best Marvel movies so far and at leat in the top 5. On a serious note for all you non-asians: not every asian likes karaoke, and I am one of them. ;)",14 November 2021
griffinzw, Best MCU film of 2021 so far.,"Really great performances and a good plot that has some truly beautiful and wonderful moments. The inclusion of Chinese culture, creatures and architecture was inspired. One of the best MCU villains ever.The characters leave a little to be desired as they aren't always well written. The CGI isn't great and sometimes is perfectly fine and other times looks really bad.Best Marvel movie of 2021 so far.",13 November 2021
Vis-Captain, Fantastic story that pulled me in every step of the way,"I don't give 10/10 stars on most things but this was close. The thing that makes this different from a bunch of other superhero movies is that halfway through the movie I was already invested in the characters. Most origin movies focus on one or two characters to make you understand where they're coming from to prepare you for the sequel. But in this it was clear that the characters were all people with great depth. Comparing this to other marvel origin movies I would say that this one takes the cake, each and every one on one fight scene felt so tense and also like a dance. The cinematography was also brilliant, I could tell what characters were thinking and how they felt from angles and hue alone. I also really enjoyed how the movie wasn't all about Shang-Chi but it was also about all the other characters in his life and how they related to the situations they were in with him. With all this said I have to say that my favourite part was how invested I felt with several of the characters, I could understand the villains, Shang-Chi, and all the other main cast. They made it clear what they were thinking sometimes without any words, or saying something else.Shang-Chi: welcome to the MCU, I am so excited to see what comes next.",3 September 2021
adrien-pujol, Entertaining but that's it - why the hype?,"This is a beautiful movie, and it is entertaining. However the plot could not be more basic and the characters development more limited to what they could fit in between action scenes. All of this alongside some quite weird choices as to make Shaun's friend an essential character to the development of the story for future movies when she has no reason to be part of it at all, other than for being a liability... so all in all, I had a good time at the movie, but that's it. I reserve my good notes for movies that really deserve them.",12 September 2021
alorne, 1 for the comedy.,"First Marvel movie I've thought about walking out of. Sit through nearly 2 hours of over explanation and a very slow moving plot and then experience the warbling furry talking animal reminiscent of the porgs from Disney'd Starwars. The amount of high rated reviews is very suspicious. Definitely not the best marvel movie, only a couple of scenes even felt like a marvel movie.",11 September 2021

elijah-alcantara, It's a family movie,"All these 10's are suspicious, imdb should really do something about fake or reviews that came from the production crew and their friends and families.It's an ok movie. It's the same Marvel formula, forced humor but pretty visuals. Story is a bit better than recent Marvel stuff of late but still the same daddy issues (what's up with that?)",30 November 2021
risbyceonna, Different And Memorable,"This movie has a very good start. We were properly introduced to the characters and the tone was pretty light hearted and funny. The fights had good choreography for the most part, some of them did go on a bit too long but it wasn't that bad. The characters are very distinct and are well written. The humor was actually funny for the most part but it felt out of place at times. The plot wasn't too bad, it made sense and didn't have any noticeable plot holes. The only problem I have with this movie is how weak the buildup was to the big fight, it really took a lot of excitement away from it. Nevertheless, the fight was still very good. I do recommend that you watch this movie it is very fun, emotional and something to remember.",15 November 2021

tom-den-haese," Some really solid fight scenes, but that's it.","This movie lacks symbolism, decent acting and misplaces humour throughout the entire movie.It still gets 5 stars because of the superb action it portrays.

jun_dog7," It's a Marvel for sure, but there's more.","I grew up in Japan watching tons Jackie Chan movies and Kung-fu flicks. I can assure you this is a kung-fu movie a fantasy film.I don't think Marvel went into this genre. Disney implementation to Marvel works so well with this one.Fresh characters and legendary kung-fu actors altogether makes the world so complete.I really like the cinematography. The latter half of the movie is visually stunning. All the action sequences are solid and fast forward and still you can all take in the elements of them.Watching legendary kung-fu actress, Michelle Yeoh, on big screen just brought tears to my eyes with joy.And reprise of the character from previous marvel franchise makes this movie so much fun above all that.I'd definitely recommend watch this at theater with your friends and families. You'd miss out so much detail if you were to wait for streaming to come out.This is made for true movie theater experience.Enjoy the ride.",5 September 2021
soneil12, A cut above most superhero films,I'll start by saying I'm generally pretty sick of the glut of superhero movies that have dominated blockbusters for so many years now. Marvel in particular have gotten to the point where I feel many of their movies are just the same old things rehashed over and over.So I wasn't expecting much from this superhero film based on a character I'd never heard of. What a pleasant surprise it was. A movie with interesting characters that had plenty of depth. A superb cast good enough that even Michelle Yeoh's usual outstanding performance didn't upstage everyone else. Beautiful visuals like you'd expect from some of the better recent chinese films rather than a Marvel film. And the action and visual effects didn't disappoint.Well worth seeing on the big screen to truly appreciate.,23 September 2021

aeongale, Not bad for a Hollywood kung fu movie,Also not a bad Marvel film given it's weakness of obscure characters. Shang-Chi didn't pop up much in the 616 during the last 15 years of comic events. More of a Marvel Knights series character in recent times. What real saves the film is Awkwafina's performance of the quirky sidekick. She's actually funny rather than annoying.,13 November 2021
AndyCordReviews, Great choreography and compelling world-build,"Entertaining from the get-go, alluring with an excellent build-up and great choreography that takes you back to the 'Crouching Tiger' era, Shang-Chi adds an interesting dynamic to the MCU.The two main leads are compelling, I loved the comedic timing of Awkwafina and the seamless choreography of the movie, everything flowed easily, and the color palette and cinematography are also compelling arguments here. My favorite scene is a harmonious ""dance"" between two characters that grabbed me to the screen and didn't let go.Overall, if you enjoy Chinese mythology mixed in with the familiarity of the MCU then you are sure to enjoy this origin story, the best one since 'Black Panther', for me at least. It got me hyped about what is coming!Be on the lookout for two after-credits scenes!",26 September 2021

unsure-1," Boring, lame CGI","It's very meh... The CGI is very cringe at times. But it has its audience, I get that. Just didn't care for the characters, the plot, the mystery. Nice to see Trevor Slattery though. And the fight scenes are cool. It definitely has its audience which is cool, but so far it's 0/2 for the new Marvel phase (including Eternals)",12 November 2021
omarcantbestopped, I didn't like it because...,"Maybe it's just me but I didn't like it as much.I forgot Ben Kingsley's character after so many years and how is it tie up to this?Why is Awkwafina in this and how the heck is she a superhero? I mean this is stupid.The action was badass and the entire family, father, mother, son and daughter are perfectly casted and we're great.The rest I didn't care for and the dragon storyline wasn't necessary.Is that all there is from Hollywood is Superheroes movies?",15 November 2021

kennyboga78, A very weal MCU movie,"I really dont get why this movie gets all this praise.....
It starts fine with some fine marshall arts and a drop of humor. Then its slows down on to exposition hell for a while full hour, before it rounds of with a weak climaxOne of the weakest MCU movies together with Black widow, Thor 2, Antman.2 and The hulk if it counts.",6 September 2021
michaelxqh, Give Tony Leung An Oscar,"If you don't know Tony Leung's influence in the Chinese movie industry, I recommend watching Grandmaster by Wong Kar-Wai (probably one of the best Chinese movie in this century). The story itself really didn't impress me, because every Marvel movie sort of has a pattern by now, and the script writers are basically replacing different characters into corresponding spots. However, I do get Marvel's intention of enlarging their superhero community to outside of the western world through the huge amount of mandarin conversation. Also, as a typical Chinese, the movie's theme of parent's expectation colliding with the new generation's rebellion, really resonates with me. Specifically, Tony Leung's depiction of an adherent, reserved, and occasionally ruthless father is one biggest reason I gave this film a 7. Talk about character, I truly don't appreciate the performance of our protagonist: I think the long and dull middle section describing Shang's mother's death is simply trying to waste time and cover up the fact that this character has no soul. Aside from that, the actions scenes are pretty well-done, especially the starting due between Wenwu and Shang's mother. Go watch Grandmaster, it has better fight scenes of true martial artists.",4 September 2021
kamfg, Perfect movie.,"Amazing movie. I'm not a big marvel buff, I like all the movies just fine. I watched this on a plane and I never wanted it to end. As soon as it ended I almost restarted it from the beginning but there was only 20min left in the flight. It's like avatar meets marvel. Beautiful choreography. Fight scenes seemed like a synchronized dance.",21 January 2022
anoran108, Mildly Entertaining,Simu Liu was really miscast. I kept thinking of him as the quirky son from Kim's Convenience! They really needed a younger Donnie Yen or Chow Yun Fat to be the lead actor on this. Plus Ben Kingsley and Awkafina...REALLY? Very disappointing...had so much potential.,15 November 2021
hcoldwell, Better Than Most Marvel Media !,It was fun and enjoyable which is rule number 1 for a good film. Has its flaws but I don't care I had a good time with it and brought in many possibilities to this large Universe of madness.,3 September 2021
mikevginkel, Among the best marvel origins,"This movie surprised me big time. The plot was pretty much what i expected it to be.

carlwilkessob, A bit run of the mill,Starts well enough and has good dose of comedy and hard hitting action sequencesHowever it quickly tails off and is very predictableScope for the character to grow in the new mcu and hopefully the funny female sidekick will return as she was a highlight.

fjmsoftware," Pretty much what I expected, with just one surprise.","I could tell from the trailer exactly what this was, i.e. A boring 2010-era superhero movie, and of the worst kind where the primary ""power"" means lots of fighting with fists and legs (almost as boring as everything based on Daredevil, just a bit better because of a hint of actual superpowers or super-objects).But there was one welcome surprise: the Bagua Zhang fights and everyone involved in them, especially the first 1-on-1 fight in the forest, which went unmatched in beauty for the whole rest of the movie. That's a scene I will be re-watching several times, guaranteed. The rest of the movie though... didn't really need to exist, just like the vast majority of 2010-era superhero movies.",14 November 2021
alexglimbergwindh, What black panther was supposed to be,This movie is what they were trying to do with black panther - but shang shi succseededAlso happy to see marvel learned how to make fight scenes.

remoadventure, OK but not great,"This felt lightweight as far as MCU movies go.It was like watching an episode of the current Kung Fu"" TV series (Olivia Liang) - but with a bigger budget.That Olivia Liang ""Kung Fu"" TV series is excellent by the way - great script, acting, and fight scenes.One expects a movie like ""Shang-Chi"" to be much, much better. Otherwise, what's the point of going to the movies?",13 December 2021
philip-ternstrom, Mediocre,"The story is super boring unfortunately, because I think the actors are doing a good job with what they have, and are generally likable.The cgi is weak, especially in the last half of the movie. It's just ... tacky.Regarding the fighting, some people compare this to Jackie Chan movies, but it's nothing like that except for the first fight scene. Then it's wuxia fighting, over the top dramatic kung fu that's not believable. It's less Ip Man and more Hero. And that's bad.The cameos are shoe-horned in. I mean come on, why would Wong be at the golden daggers club? The abomination? And the scene in the end with the two well known heroes are also nonesensical and feels like it's there to justify the movie in the bigger MCU.Also, when I watch a Spider-Man movie, I don't want to see just Peter Parker. The same is true here, it's just in the movies last scenes we actually get to see Shang-Chi instead of just Shaun the kung fu guy.",12 September 2021

NullUnit, Was this made for the United States?,"It's very TYPICAL Marvel .... zero surprises in storylines or characters. It's becoming sooooo repetitive in every single ""Avengers"" movie.This film WAS different in one aspect though.... over 80% of all dialog is SUBTITLED. It's as if it were a Chinese film that was released in the U. S.. Seriously, most of the dialog is in Mandarin (Or Cantonese I can't tell the difference). This made this unbearable because there was no story to follow if you didn't ""read along"". But the good thing is you really didn't HAVE to read anything to get the story.. as posted, it's not original.. it's the same as pretty much every other Avengers origin story.It's long stretches of subtitled dialog broken up with, well, more dance sequences than fighting.Why 4 stars.. production was good, as expected. Otherwise a 2 star effort. I mean, I could go read the comics if everything is going to be subtitled.",28 November 2021
vansfromearth, MCU Origins Masterpiece!,Shang-Chi was a refreshing new movie to the usual Marvel styling of making origin character movies. It also was proper Asian representation!!!The casting was perfect!The pace of the movie spot on!The soundtrack was great!The costumes loved!The CGI well done!The talking and banter was all done at the right places!The whole time was really engaged into the movie!

I never saw a comic book movie with this much powerhouse performances. They all did so good, I will see this movie again and again. I can't wait for sequels!

leemeldrum, Biggest Marvel dud yet,"I'm a bit late to this review as I waited for the Disney channel release rather than go to the cinema.I'm very happy with my choice! If I'd spent money going to see this I would have been even more disappointed than I already am.By far the weakest MCU film to date in almost every way. The story was at best okay, the jokes missed the mark more often than not, the fight scenes were messy and childish looking and the effects weee probably the worst I've seen in the universe, cartoony and like a bad video game.The main cast were too old for the characters they were portraying, watching it felt like people in their 30s playing people in their 20 who acted like 15 year oldsI really hope these characters get left behind during phase 4 to be honest. MCU made a massive casting mistake and because of it I can't see how it can be reframed for them to come into the wider spectrum unless through the multiverse new actors can come in.As bad to the MCU as Iron Fist was to Netflix.",21 November 2021

What??,"The movie was so pointless... the plots doesn't make any sense at all, overall bad CGI, bad jokes hijack the only meaningful scene from the story that ruins the scene completely, the whole movie was like it was made for 5 year-olds.

onemckinney, Not my cup 'o tea.,"There is some good acting in this movie, cinematography and visual effects. Certainly some well choreographed action and martial arts scenes. However, the story line is somewhat lacking. It also tries its hand at some comic moments but most don't cut the mustard, I'm managed a couple of small giggles along with my fellow cinema going compatriots.",3 October 2021
luismcmlxii," Fun, exciting but flawed.","This movie really surprised me I loved the action scenes specially the one that takes place in a bus, I wish they kept that ""grounded"" action line but at the end they go with big cgi fights, which are good but I just really loved those hand to hand action scenes.Also I find the villian irrelevant, he isn't too bad for you to hate him nor he isn't too good to be loved.",6 October 2021

Decided not to watch Marvel or any of these super hero stuff in theaters for the next 1-2 years. Will wait for streaming services to show these. .,27 September 2021
qstufie, Unexpected fun movie with pretty good story and acting,"Leon Liang is a great actor known to Asian audience and I didn't know his English was this good, and as expected, the acting was natural!The character of Shang-Chi's Dad really stole the show - you get to understand where he's coming from and instead of a pure evil being like the comic books depicts, he's now just a man in flesh & bones and desperate in getting his lost lover back.The action was really good considering Yuen Wah was in it he probably contributed a lot there, it feels like a Jackie Chan movie (even the iconic scenes of fights in the scaffolding is there!!!) and there's not stupid angle cuts and stuff like shots of a fist and then another second someone's flying, instead you get the complete scene where multiple ppl are fighting and there's no offscreen cuts.Over all, the breakdown:
Graphics: 9 (Lucas Studio was behind it)

asterblasterth, CGI wasn't great but...,It's forgiven. Wasn't too high on this movie after watching the trailers but to my surprise I actually really liked it. The only part I didn't like was the CGI parts in the beginning of the movie. It was the forest scene and bus scene. Very cheap CGI ut after that the CGI got better where it didn't botter me anymore. But like I said the rest of the movie I really enjoyed where I first didn't think I would.,10 November 2021

imysticalbliss, Amazing movie!! Looking forward to the next one.,"It honestly shocks me on how many people would give this movie a low rating. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best films that has come out this year. This film has a lot of action, comedy and has soul. I felt very connected to this film. It's very unique and the actors performed very well. The cinematography, visuals were crafted beautifully and the music composition worked wonderfully together. A lot of hard work has been put into this film and it definitely shows. This movie deserves the rating it gets from me and I'll be seeing this again tomorrow.",4 September 2021
stevenjackson-01402," Simmer down, yes it's Marvel, but is it?","This movie has been much anticipated, but in my opinion it fell short.Marvel to me is absolute gold (along with the Dark Knight saga).This movie lacked humor (apart from Mr slattery). CGI was way over the top and wire fighting was too obvious. As a kung fu movie, this failed.",11 September 2021
sonnygoten," The American side was to the point, Asian side felt off","The best parts of the story are those that were set in the USA, as they gave a nice and on point glimpse into the culture of Americans of ethnic Chinese origin. But as soon as the story moves on to Macau, and then to a ""mysterious unknown location in China"" where the Ten Rings are located, and then even further into the mystical ""Chinese"" village called Ta Lo, the movie missed the mark further and further; and it becomes increasingly obvious that this story is told entirely through an American lens, because the ""Chinese"" parts seems more like a flanderized/Disney-fied version of Chinese culture (which isn't very surprising, considering that this movie is produced by Disney). Also, while China does have outsized influence on East (and to a lesser extent South East) Asian culture (the same way that the influence of Ancient Roman culture is outsized in regards to Europe), Disney seems to think that Chinese and Asian is basically interchangeable, which is a common perception in Hollywood, but not actually true.In other words, the last 2/3 parts are an orientalist fantasy version of Chinese-ish ""culture"", a poor facsimile of Chinese-ness that's devoid of anything truly Chinese in heart or spirit. It (just as many other renditions Hollywood has made of ""Chinese"" or ""Asian"" movies) felt jarringly off the mark.That being said, the movie also has its good points. The actors are pretty good and engaging, especially Tony Leung is on point in his acting. The more dramatic/emotional moments of the story are also properly balanced out by the humor to make this into a nice and quick, lighthearted watch that we all know from Marvel's brand. The action at the start is also pretty good, though the last 1/3 part suffers from the usual CGI-fest that you can expect from most superhero movies. And there aren't many pacing issues in the movie either.All in all, a solid watch for the average Marvel fan. But a disappointment for people who are used to seeing Asian movies produced by actual Asians from Asian countries.",29 January 2022
ipratt-12182, Disappointing start for Shang Chi,"I can't understand why people are rating this 10 /10, it's ok, good special effects and fight scene's but story and the supposed laughs just didn't work for me, go and see free guy for a 10 /10 film.",4 September 2021
velusaragoppan, So Damn Good!,"This is how you take super ability and make it realistic. Nothing was overdone, not even the CGI. They took their time with the story development, yet there was enough tension between the characters to drive the fight scenes... What an amazing intro to some Shang Chi characters; Simu Liu is fantastic and the core of the film really sticks with the audience. This was legit.",2 September 2021
praveenpande-77691, Razzle Dazzle....without Fu Manchu,"Decent action fantasy adventure, the asian twist give s it an uplift with over the top razzle dazzle.However the Shang Chi storyline unfortunately is definitely not from the comics, pretty disappointed as Shang Chi is very sombre.chaacter who is at war with his father Fu Manchu who is a scheming powerful scary dude, the conflict between them is epic and forms the basis of the core of the storyline.Dont think Shang Chi is a required not relevant chanracter in this movie, the requirement is just for an action hero, seems like Marvel ran out of ideas how to introduce Shang Chi to the audience.",12 November 2021
RayBagel, The standout amongst Marvel's lineup,"Marvel has finally released a movie that isn't a complete abomination.Action was heavy in the film, with great choreography and clear shots. The villain of the film was well put together, there was no ambiguity or salvation fluff. The Chinese sequences and actors of the film were excellent. However, the American counterparts performed poorly; some viewers may find the American humour entertaining. For me, If Awkwafina's character was omitted, the movie would've been an 8/10.It's a long film, but it's worth a watch if you're into martial arts and superheroes.",5 September 2021
teiixeiral, An interesting blend of styles.,"I enjoyed Shang-Chi. As far as origin stories go in the MCU, this one was one of the better ones. It doesn't quite feel like a Marvel film but that's okay because it's still great.The action scenes are inspired. It's almost a homage of sorts to the classic style of fighting made popular by chinese cinema, but very well executed. Tony Leung delivers a standout performance as one of the best villains in the entire MCU thus far. The look of the film is excellent too with some great CGI and beautiful cinematography.This is another hit for Marvel, and a surprising one at that too.",15 November 2021
xbrmjxg, Typical Marvel Film,First of all I have to say that the action sequences of this movie were great and it's cinematography was on point. The REAL Mandarin aka shang chi's father is easily the best marvel villain for me. Plus it was refreshing to see the ten rings in action. The story was good but I wish there were some changes in the script to make the movie more interesting as it got a bit slow in the second half. The climax was a bit dramatic. There were some moments which could have been better if the script was right. In the end as a marvel fan it's a great film but as a Superhero fan who isn't really into particular studio can find this movie an okayish one.,11 September 2021

Awkwafina is the normal person thrown into the foray , Simu Liu might be a newcomer for most but as a Toronto resident, I'm bias and rooting for him. Film is clean, great for family.

The visuals were amazing, it was a very heartfelt story and Simu Liu's and Tony Leung's performances were truly extraordinary.I didn't give it 10 stars because the final battle felt a little underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the movie (something I have noticed is a common theme in Marvel movies).Would honestly give it a 9.5.",16 September 2021

THE dragon fight at end was just wow and the way the rings were used sometimes like spiderman and sometimes an invisible chair is so good . Plus I think it has one of the great post credit scenes. It needs to be enjoyed in the biggest screen possible with 3d.",7 September 2021
rajitecture, Just watch the first half and turn the movie off after...,Good movie up till the end of the Macau scene. The rest of the movie turns into a childish flying dragon fantasy show.

thatfilmperson, A perfect Marvel movie,"If you liked:
Jackie Chan films
Bruce Lee films
Doctor StrangeNote: as I always say Marvel and DC films can really only be compared to one another, within their own segment of the movie industry. But even if I were to compare ""Shang-Chi"" to any other film, it would have been a 9/10.A perfect Marvel movie. Trust me, I've watched all 25 of them and the only Marvel films that come close to the richness of story, character development and sheer epicness of Shang-Chi are Doctor Strange, Thor Ragnarok and the last two Avengers. The film perfectly balances story and character development with action scenes so that throughout the whole two hours you never get tired of neither. There are no unnecessary filler scenes, there aren't any 40-min long scenes explaining the childhood background of the main character you sometimes see in such films; the flashbacks of the past are smartly intertwined as short clips within the overarching main story. The fights are absolutely amazing, obviously inspired by Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee moves (with a pinch of Kill Bill). The story is as deep and as personal as it can get for a Marvel film (honestly better than most drama films nowadays); and some scenes are as epic and vast as the final battles in Endgame or the last Hobbit movie. This is what Mulan and Raya should have looked like. And the great thing is that it doesn't rely on any of the previous Marvel movies whatsoever - a fully standalone project with completely new characters.You must watch it in a theater if you can.",15 September 2021

The acting was good and the visuals were great but the story is essentially the same cookie cutter we have seen a million times.It really feels like Marvel is 0/2 Post end game with this and black widow.The other thing that forces the score down for me is Bri Larson's insignificant cameo (she just is not good for her role and has zero charisma! And the forced ""Girl Power"" moments.

frozenBagofPease12345, A legit kung fu movie.,"This movie 'almost' breaks the mold of being yet another super hero movie. It really rides the line of being a movie to finally genre break a movie in the MCU. It genuinely felt like a proper kung fu movie with excellent choreography and legitimate fighting styles and some plot tropes of the older kung fu films. It even manages some chi bending stuff. I really thought this would be a boring injection of a new character, but as a fan of old kung fu movies I thoroughly enjoyed this one and it gives me some hope that the MCU can get a little more risky with stepping out side the super hero genre within the same universe.",5 January 2022

andyfst, Not up to par Marvel!!!,First of all I'm glad Marvel did an Asian movie so called Legend of ten rings. CGI is perfect. Casting actors and actresses from China is the right move. But the main casting and supporting just don't click. Plus the story like feels like the writer doesn't have a clue on Chinese culture or just finish up as school homework kinda of storyline. If Marvel plan to add this story and character into future sequence. Huge mistake!!!,15 November 2021
marcusliuhk," Do not recommend, maybe watch it when you need to","As title said, if later in a mcu movie, it is needed to watch it to know a bit more of his history then go ahead. This movies sucks, I have never been so disappointed with a marvel movie as this one. Exclude those early early ones. Let me point out a few probables, the story doesn't even make much sense, or even doesn't interested me. Same old storyboard, similar run through, expected ending, nothing surprises me. Second, the main actor simu, damm a lot to improvement, in acting skill, wise. Watching close ups of his fighting scenes literally made this movie a comedy. The lack of expression, doesn't connect with the character. I'd prefer wen Wu a lot more than Shang chi. In actor of course. Wen Wu's actor is probably one of the rarest thing in the movie that would add points to the rating. I can tell he is very experienced, he can fully express the characters feeling, emotion and status to the audience.Personally can't believe they already signed a second movie with that main actor, but who knows what Kevin feige is thinking.",31 January 2022

sebastiannagra, Shang-Chi - Wasted potential.,"69/100Shang-Chi is, at its core, a people pleasing Marvel movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Due to this, there isn't really all too much to say about this one.Storywise, it was simple and unchallenging, following Shang-Chi as he attempts to prevent the end of the world. Standard fare for most action films. The characters and their motivations all feel flat, outside of Shang-Chi and Katy, who provide a fun duo for the first two acts of the film. As with almost every Marvel film, it's swamped in CGI, leading to it being visually inseparable from the rest of the catalogue. The fight choreography felt fun, with the two types starkly contrasting: the CTHD inspired duels, and the modern, almost dance-like brawls. Outside of a passing character appearance and a post-credit scene, there is no real reference to the overall MCU, leaving me thinking this film would have worked better as a fully standalone one, especially for an otherwise relatively unknown character. My main complaint is with the story, and how little happened in the runtime. They could have developed characters more, they could have touched more on the 1000 years the father was alive and how it affected him, they could have put more into telling the story of the soul-sucking dragon and where it is trapped. But none of this happens. This film is, yes, alright, but it had potential to be so much better.I can't be arxed to paragraph this, so have this all in one big lump.",2 October 2021

Just throw in some special effects and over the top fighting scenes and you are good to go, no matter how poor the writing might be at points.The first fight scene near the very beginning made me think this movie was going to be something different, something good, maybe even a bit special.As it turned out, It was definitely different when compared with other films made previously from the MCU, just not in the way I had hoped.Very Disneyfied in the end, but the new modern day Disney not the old one.

That's my top downfall for this movie.As for the rest, the movie did an excellent job to introduce the story and plot while still keeping some mystery. It also did not spend too much time in the character development so the movie did not seem to have long scenes. Special effects were well done, although, you cannot remove the lighting lacks of CGI when interacting with real humans.I think this is a nice movie to watch because of a nice oriental twist to the Marvel Univers, refreshing with some solid foundations for futur movies to come. So good job on this movie and worth to watch even if you never watched a Marvel Movie, you won't get too lost in the plots since Shang-Chi is a movie of it's own with a nice futur!",17 January 2022

I can't really sympathy with him. The sidekicks in this story have more interesting background or personality (for ex.

ryanwesthamfan, Another Good Edition To The MCU,"The Good- This film blends all of it's genres in very nicely. It is one part martial arts. One part family drama and one part fantasy. One of the things the MCU is good at is telling stories from different genres and making them fit within the universe and this film does exactly that. This has some of the best fight sequences within the MCU. The dynamic between Shang Chi and Awkwafina's character has a very nice dynamic between the two and really play of each other. All of the characters play a part into the story and none of them really feel pushed to the side. The Villain is also one of the better ones we have in the MCU as he has these conflicting values and we see both his good and bad side. It also isn't very predictable to see what he is going to do next. Finally the director feels like they were given a lot more freedom than usual inside MCU films because of how the story is told there hasn't been many films that have been told in this sort of style or tackling these sort of issues. This movie feels like a significant film into the MCU and moving forward in the MCU which was one of my issues with 'Black Widow'. Overall it delivered everything you want from an MCU film plus some new stuff which I enjoyed.The Mixed- The humour made me laugh and I found some of it funny. But there is a lot of forced MCU humour. If you are one of them people who are tired from the quick one liners we have in the MCU then this movie is going to frustrate you.The Bad- One of the biggest problems is the MCU template in the sense that it has to have all these jokes, a massive CGI battle at the end and has to tie into the MCU in different ways. Some of the humour works in the moment but others just fell so forced.Overall Thoughts- Overall 'Shang Chi' is a exciting mix of the MCU, martial arts, family genre and fantasy. I loved the martial arts aspect but you can tell the MCU formula trying to cheapen the experience a little bit. However put it all together you get yet another MCU film that knows what's coming next. Yet not quite a top teir MCU movie. Overall I'm going to give Shang Chi a 8/10.",6 September 2021

Light52, A great Martial Arts film,"This is a beautiful film. There are some spectacular shots that you can tell are inspired by classes Chinese cinema. Wide shots of beautiful landscapes with real martial artists make you feel, sometimes, like you truly aren't just watching another Marvel movie, which even the best Marvel films struggle with.The story is good, though it does too often rely on the standard Marvel plot points that are in almost all of these movies. But the film is truly lifted up by its incredible action. This is hands down the best action in the MCU, and after seeing Black Widow, which was terrible, cutting every half second during fights, this film utilizing wide shots and long takes was a breath of fresh air. There's a lot to love here and if it wasn't for some of the odd choices and the humor, which was about 50/50 hit or miss for me, then this would be a 10 star film. It's definitely worth watching.",19 September 2021
lucaslw-93145," Huge movie, a great addition to Phase 4","Black Widow kicked off Phase 4 with relatively muted excitement. Blame BW's performance on the pandemic, pirating, whatever. But for a movie that's several years overdue and months delayed, it was an underwhelming opening to the next step of the MCU both in story quality and action directing.Shang-Chi does a lot of heavy lifting and bounces Phase 4 back to Marvel's in-form output with one of the strongest Origin-Story films yet. A combination of a great cast and actor chemistry, palatable plot and storytelling, and the vibrant beauty of Chinese & Chinese-American culture interwoven naturally into the interactions between characters makes Shang-Chi an incredibly fun film for anyone not up-to-date on the MCU and an instant favorite for any die-hard MCU fans. And yet, even with each strong component that this film brings to the table, the most noteworthy highlight is that Shang-Chi has managed to seamlessly adapt Kung Fu choreography into the BEST hand-to-hand fight choreography that the MCU has ever seen. (Yes, in my opinion, it's better than the fight choreo from CA:Winter Soldier; that's no small feat). The action sequences here, backed by a well-fitting and punchy soundtrack make the action of Shang-Chi almost as exciting as that of the best Avengers movies.Not a perfect film by any means, some of the story elements are not fully developed and we also have the scheduled 3rd act CGI battle that seems to come with every MCU movie. Even so, the highs certainly outweigh the lows and in all, highly recommend seeing this movie. My thoughts are too cluttered by the awe inspired by the movie so a quick recap of the pros:Great action (no seriously, really great action. This is the John Wick of superhero films)Stunning visualsGreat soundtrackGreat cast, very fun interactionsTony Leung is incredible in this movie; the antagonist of this film is a Top 3 MCU ""villain""Simu Liu seems like a really great guy. Congrats on the success my dude.",7 September 2021

Absolutely there is no DOUT,this movie would be one of the Best ACTION film in MCU. This movie has so much of action that we never experienced in MCU quite often.

I would say everyone should watch this movie in theaters and experience the action and the music(bgm) was so awesome😍.THIS MOVIE 🎥 IS GOING TO BRING NEW ERA OF SUPERHERO.",3 September 2021
ridsidorova, It looks like a modernized,"It looks like a modernized version of some big-budget Jackie Chan movie. And with the accompanying elements of the wuxia genre. Even the main character was given the features of the familiar image of the famous Chinese - the same modest, good-natured simpleton, skillfully owning martial arts. The film certainly makes an impression, mainly due to those mechanisms that work well for Marvel - these are action scenes that are masterfully done here and a light tone of narration with pleasant humor. In a word, the attraction is really entertaining. Also with oriental flavor, lush colors of beautiful landscapes, subtle rhythm of battles. But what fails - an entertaining story, compelling dramaturgy, family drama - at least it does not focus on itself in a negative way. Rather, it is perceived simply as a typical basis on which the more successful aspects of a work of art shine.",19 January 2022

The main character is waiting for a large number of secrets concerning his family. Together with their friends, they go in search of the truth. I advise you to watch this movie picture. She will not let you get bored during the entire session. The convulsions and dynamic scenes going back to the time of old China are very well demonstrated.",19 January 2022
salazhenkin, God,"In the last year, Disney has been leaning on Chinese cuisine. ""Mulan"", ""Raya and the Last Dragon"", and now ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"". The set of ingredients is surprisingly similar: we collect time-tested techniques and plot elements, throw them into a pile, upload them to the neural network and create a script. Good savings come out during the pandemic, you don't have to pay the screenwriters. In any case, I do not want to believe that these three projects had real licensed screenwriters, otherwise I will have to put up with the complete degeneration of the profession under the control of Disney. All three films are united by both the mentioned secondary nature and a disregard for the created world. The main thing is to introduce more mascotics to sell toys, and inclusivity, so that the press splashes with saliva. And the plot is for some strange people outside the target audience. The new film of the Marvel cinematic universe almost fell victim to many factors. The same scenario - it is bad, predictable, consists of everything that any viewer, whether he is a movie fan or just getting acquainted with cinema, has seen if not hundreds, then at least dozens of times. In the center, the main character is of Asian origin, living a quiet American life, but finding himself embroiled in a showdown of supernatural forces directly related to his past. He travels to different locations, meets his father, the villain, fights with him, and in the end reveals all his powers and enters into a confrontation with an older evil. Unless the main character does not turn into Mark Dakaskas, as in the TV series ""Killers of Wu"", but otherwise everything is like in a multi-series with Iko Yuvais. The second problem is the characters. Malomal charisma is possessed only by supporting actors and beyond. In the foreground, you have to look at the one-dimensional Sima Liu and Aquafina (the young lady compensates for the lack of charisma with zero acting and tantrums). Even the beauty Zhang Menger managed to depersonalize, age, and in the second half of the film completely deprive of replicas. 59-year-old Tony Leung has to carry drama and pathos, and 77-year-old Ben Kingsley has to carry humor. And what can you do if young people can't cope? However, two absolutely important problems are destroyed at the click of the Infinity Gauntlet when old Chinese militants come into play. They were lovingly cut into fragments and filled to the brim with the possibilities of modern cinema. Here's a fight on the bus, but on bamboo scaffolding - we have repeatedly seen all this at the same Jackie Chan. However, add to this a modern budget, special effects and the ability to shoot from almost any angle and get a completely new impression of the old as the world of movie fights. Yes, as in the script, it's just tracing paper from repeatedly passed and digested. But with what a soul it is recreated! The action in ""Shang Chi"" is the best and most memorable part of the film. Ideally, one day I would like to see an ""anti-director version"" of the tape, where the entire plot and dialogues will be cut out, leaving 40-50 minutes of enjoyment for the eyes. It would be possible to continue to scold the film by putting a lower rating, but it will not work - the beauty of fights almost without firearms is enough here so that the movie does not upset, but on the contrary, awakens the belief that the most inclusive phase of the MCU will be better than it seems at the moment. It's not worth waiting for miracles from the plot of the upcoming tapes right now, but at least it surprises the directors at least sometimes, but it still works out. So we sit until the end of the credits and go to sing karaoke, like all normal heroes-viewers who, despite the falling quality, still remain with Marvel.",19 January 2022
katyilina, the movie is good,"I've said this before about Marvel films: they are victims of their own success. Shang-Chi was supposed to follow a decade and a half of quality MCU movies, so the same movie that would have been amazing 10 years ago isn't exactly viewed as well today. The film was good, but it failed to really stand out.""Legend of the Ten Rings"" as a title is already too similar to LOTR. And in fact it was something like the fact that he had power with the rings. Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) had ten rings that gave him almost omnipotence. With ten rings, he could defeat entire armies and live forever. He decided to use the rings to become a tyrant.He was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life, the woman he found after living 1,000 years. I found it a little odd that it took a man 1,000 years to find his true love, but I didn't dwell on it.",19 January 2022

markodincov, The movie exceeded my expectations,"Hello everybody.The other day I watched a movie called Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021).At first, the length of this film frightened me a little, but nevertheless I decided to watch it and I do not regret watching it.Film Genre: Action, Fantasy. It is also worth adding that this film is a superhero film from the world of Marvel, so fans of this should watch it, especially since the film turned out to be excellent.Plot: to be honest, I'm already confused about these super heroes, since Marvel (and not only) has a lot of them now) First, we are told the story of Xu Wenwu, who has artifacts in the form of Ten Rings in his hands. They are magical and endow this person with superpowers and besides this, immortality, as I understand it. But... he is not the main character of the film) The story will go on about his son Shang Chi. What will be discussed and what tests await him? - can be seen in the film.The actors played their roles perfectly. I liked the fight scenes, costumes, scenery and so on.I also want to note the bright and cool graphics, although this is not new now and it is difficult to surprise the viewer - but I liked it)
The duration of the film is a little more than 2 hours, but the viewing time flew by unnoticed, as the film turned out to be dynamic, interesting, exciting and bright.All in all, I liked the movie and it exceeded my expectations. So from me there will be a rating of five and recommendations for viewing.",19 January 2022
savely17, Good,"""Shang-chi"" is conceived as a story of the formation of a hero who acquires supernatural abilities: like his father, he knows how to control ten magic rings. And the screenwriters managed to masterfully combine several themes in this story at once: heredity, reverence for elders (prevalent in Asian culture), the search for self, overcoming difficulties and awareness of their strengths.For once, the hero is really struggling with internal and external demons - remorse because of the abandoned family and abusive father, who could not really get attached to him. The conflict is based on understandable and simple emotions - pain, resentment and distrust - so it is surprisingly easy to sympathize with the main character. And when Shang-chi succeeds, the audience sees how hard he earned them. The strength of the film is not only in the main character, but in a whole group of interesting characters. Katie, played by Aquafina- is an ordinary girl without superpowers, an analogue of Darcy Lewis from the Thor films. Throughout the first half of the picture, she seems to personify the audience with popcorn in her hands, commenting on what is happening and constantly making jokes. But it's not only Aquafina's comedic talent that makes the heroine bright - closer to the finale it turns out to be very important for the plot. Sister Shang-chi Xialing perfectly combines great strength of character and at the same time the fragility of an offended, abandoned child.But the real attention of the viewer is stolen by Tony Leung Chu, who gave Marvel one of the best antagonists of recent years. Wenwu is a deeply tragic villain and a great example of how to make an antagonist multifaceted. The loss of his beloved wife really angered him, but Wenwu has always been ambitious, cruel and prone to violence. The authors of the film do not try to whitewash him, especially in unfair treatment of Shang-chi and Xialing. At the same time, you can understand Wenwu, sometimes you even want to root for him, but he remains a villain from the first to the last appearance.",19 January 2022
Jaymz13, The Story Has Been Told For Thousands Of Years...,"The narrator, in one breath, claims the story has been told for thousands of years. In the next breath, she claims this mystery man sought power for a thousand years as the year ""1996"" appears on the screen. So my question is, how many thousands of years has it been since 1996?I know it seems like such a minor thing. After all, this is a Marvel fantasy. But to introduce the story in such a sloppy way? No. You already lost me in the first five minutes. I'm tired of flashy movies that forget they need to make sense at least within the confines of their own universe. Flash only holds my attention for a few seconds. That alone isn't enough to keep me watching for two hours.Jeers, Marvel. Do better.",25 January 2022

mafesta-58589, neutral opinion,"With all the problems of Shang-Chi, however, I don't want to scold what the world is worth: the film is monstrously beautiful, fans of Mortal Kombat will be stunned here (the choreography of some battle scenes is breathtaking), and fans of Hayao Miyazaki's paintings (dragon !). The film is also surprisingly accurate and poignant when it comes to family trauma (there is some continuity with Black Widow); if you have unresolved issues with your father, it is better to take a handkerchief with you. In addition, the ""Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of those ""Marvel"" attractions that does not pull to cut at least half an hour, and this is already worth a lot; and in the end - what a bad movie can be with Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung.",19 January 2022
vishwatej286, One time watchable (5.6/10) For Tony Leung,"After Marvel Phrase 3, I expected better story. I don't understand how this movie is relevant to Marvel Superhero. If you have an Intellectual Property that doesn't mean to promote and marketing of the movie you would say it comes under Superhero universe.Marvel can't make A Stand alone movie any more. It has to be forcefully part of other movies.Coming to Shang Chi and the Ten Rings movie was some how watchable. But there is no depth or back story with other supporting characters. And also few things just happens because it's magical movie. There is no relevance or needed. Awkwafina was there just for gags and comedy relief but there is not a single character growth or back story to her character. But she was better than Simu Liu who played Shang Chi. He felt like he don't want to be In this movie. There was no comfortable performance from him.Only 2 actors shines in the movie are Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh.1st time Antagonist character motivation felt more understandable than Protagonists character.You will like antagonist character because there was a depth to his story, there is an emotion is linked.Other characters you won't give a damn. Especially Shang Chi's Sister.Mediocre dialogues
Boring story sometimes
CGI was too much cartoonish
Characters behaviour won't change from beginning till the end. There won't be any consequences after such big action (Bus sequence, and car drifting). Seriously no one asks!!!!",2 December 2021
kasatkinamaria, Very good even,"Like many Marvel films, Shang-Chi's film turned out great. The acting is just great. But the actors themselves, in my opinion, are chosen not quite correctly. In place of the main character, I wanted to see a strong, pumped-up person, and not a strong ""Pukhlyash"". But in general, if you do not find fault with the actors, then the plot of the film is done cool, even with strange moments that you do not expect at all, such as meeting with a headless animal, which additionally creates interest.Watching a movie creates a certain tension, because it is not clear what can happen next.

It also resolves a previous issue in a marvel film which disappointed many fans, the film deserves credit for that. Great action scenes and tells a very convincing origin story which is well earnt.

dannyrest," Mixed feelings, good VFX but terrible comedy",I really enjoyed the VFX in the movie. Fight scenes were not very believable from the leads. The acting as others mentioned wasn't that great either. The lame jokes were for little kids that wouldn't even be old enough to watch this. Too bad they couldn't decide what the target audience was and make it more adult like it should have been. Well worth watching and still a keeper for the visuals but better off turning off the audio for it.,10 November 2021
dannyrest, Impressive movie but does have a few small flaws,"Personally I do not care what race any superhero is since it is irrelevant. This movie was quite impressive with the VFX but some of the humour was a bit too childish and seemed out of place. Seems like the humour was for a lower age group than the intended age targets watching the movie. I would have preferred this was more adult than kiddie. I can't complain about the acting or the story, they seemed adequate for me in this movie and easily overlooked from the visuals I was more interested in. Considering the movie is based on magical superheroes the obvious flaws in logic don't apply and the mistakes are easily overlooked. I enjoyed this one enough to add it my collection and won't hesitate to watch again. Definitely was worth the watch.This movie is fill wth lot's of word's of wisdom. Here's some for people before they start jumping on soapboxes about races of characters in movies or pointing their fingers in any direction;
1 - Racists come in all colours, shapes and sizes. The only thing that matters is we are all part of the human race and bleed the same colour!2 - If people ever want to truly end racism then don't be hypocrites and start with your own backyards including yourselves, family, friends and associates.",10 November 2021
UrAverageMovieCritic, Overrated but enjoyable movie,"This movie is very overrated, however I cannot deny that it was overall an enjoyable movie. Unlike many movies of today, nothing seems particularly forced here, so that's a good sign from the get-go.As a Chinese myself, I found the mix between the two languages to flow really nicely throughout this movie. The Chinese dialogue was given plenty of breadth and not at all a means to an end. And overall, I found the portrayal of Chinese culture and ethnicity to be authentic.The story cliché about purpose and ""living up to your potential"" is nothing new, but I found it really meaningful here and not at all empty. There are parts of the story that fall weak, but there are more than 2,200 reviews here so I am sure all the criticisms has already been covered.Action scenes were awesome and epic. Cinematography and visuals were also great, but nothing too outstanding.It is a shame though that this Marvel movie is overshadowed by the success of its predecessors, as it's not by any means a bad movie, but it may seem that way to some. Can't say the same for Black Widow, though... now that's a truly bad movie.",5 January 2022
jaydenmccagh, I loved this movie.,"I loved this movie.Mandarin
I thought it was great getting to see the Mandarin after the Iron Man 3 portrayal and even seeing Trevor Slattery return was one of my favourite moments in Recent MCU. Tony Leung was incredible as Wenwu and delivered a compelling performance, he brought the emotional, yet unsettling character to life so well, he was amazing!Shang-Chi
You can really tell when an actor is passionate about a role, and this is one of these times. Simu Liu is so passionate about this character and it really pays off. He brings a great performance, some of my favourite scenes are with him and Wenwu (Tony Leung) having an emotional mental battle. He was great!Katy Awkwafina usually annoys me in movies, but not so much in this one. She is actually quite funny a lot of the time (apart from the forced MCU humour) and delivered a good sidekick performance!Trevor Slattery
I loved having Trevor back. He was hilarious in this movie, and I love Ben Kingsleys portrayal of this character.Xialing
I thought she was pretty cool, it's cool to see what's happening with her going forward.Overall just a great movie, the colour grading in this movie is gorgeous too! The choreography is the best we've seen in the MCU thanks to Brad Simpson (RIP) and really feels authentic to the old Jackie movies. I absolutely loved the Chinese culture in this movie, it was amazing to see it all, especially the dragons. The music was also incredible, might be my favourite MCU score!Overall 9/10!",16 October 2021
liltimmers, Bad story and character writing take away from a fun action film.,"The action sequences and cinematography are some of the best yet in the MCU. This movie is visually stunning and a pretty fun film for what it is, but the story in general was just poorly written and at times seemed amateur. There was about 7 too many slow motion scenes where characters randomly stare at each other, and the first 30-40 minutes of the film just felt so random and out of place. It is also weird that a dragon shows up at the end and sort of steals the show from Shang Chi as he is just about to start to shine and take the role as the lead protagonist. All the actors did great in their roles, but shoddy writing really brought the whole thing down for me.",5 September 2021

Well, I'm glad to say that with ""Shang-Chi - The Legend of the Ten Rings"" Marvel are back in top form. Not only is the movie excellent - opening up a great story with wonderful, engaging characters, and great new locations - but something I don't always think when I think ""Marvel movies"" is that there are many scenes in which I just thought to myself that they made a beautiful movie, too. It's really too bad that this movie didn't get the chance other Marvel movies got with a non-pandemic times movie theater release. It would've surely broken the 1-billion dollar mark.

robertrutledge, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Brace... er... Rings,"Disclaimer: I watched the Spanish dubbed version of this film. Therefore, I am unable to provide criticism of the original actors' acting in this film.Shang-Chi is a hit! One of my favorite Marvel films for sure. While it indeed takes place in the MCU, it just doesn't feel like other Marvel films, in a good way, that is. Our protagonist has no real superpowers, and the cheesy, outlandish fictional elements characteristic of many other Marvel films have been exchanged for more mystical, creative elements. As another reviewer has put it, it's almost as if this film belonged more to the Harry Potter universe than the MCU.The story revolves around Shaun (Simu Liu) and his friend Katy (Awkwafina), two young valet drivers living in San Francisco. After a rather exhilarating episode on the bus to work where a group of men steal Shaun's jade pendant, he decides to visit his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) in China to warn her that they'll be going after her next. Katy insists on joining, and during the plane ride, Shaun reveals to her his true identity and back story: he is Shang-Chi, a great martial arts warrior from China whose father Xu Wenwu (brilliantly cast by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) possesses the titular legendary rings (which are actually more like bracelets, if you ask me), which give him god-like power and immortality. They wrap around his forearms and glow bright blue, and seem to have some mystical magnetic properties. Ever since Shang-Chi and his sister's mother Li (Fala Chen) died when they were children, their father has not been right in the head and has developed an obsession for the bracelets. One day he starts hearing what he believes to be his wife's voice call out to him, and thus sets out to reunite with her in the secret city of Ta Lo, her hometown which is very hard to get to. Our heroes must stop him before he opens up Pandora's box.The visuals in this film are spectacular, especially the creative uses of bright, contrasting colors. What's really neat about this film is how the first half portrays modern Chinese culture and the second half portrays a more traditional Chinese culture. You get the best of both worlds, if you will. I am no expert on Chinese culture, by any means, but this film was made in a way that I believe respects it. The film also makes use of Mandarin language from time to time (particularly during flashbacks), which gives it more a sense of authenticity than having all the Chinese characters speak English all the time.I do have a slight criticism. In Avengers Endgame, there was an extremely cheesy and cringeworthy scene near the end where all the female characters were shown side by side, all the Black characters were shown side by side, etc. The rather random appearance of the character Wong in this movie is more or less an extension of that scene. It's as if Kevin Feige (or perhaps director Destin Daniel Cretton) said, ""Oh. We have this new Shang-Chi movie featuring a mostly Asian cast. Let's throw Wong from Dr. Strange in there because he's Asian."" It's more realistic to show characters of different races working together, and it sends a better message as well. In the same way Black Panther features a mostly Black cast, it's as if Marvel wants to make up for its previous exclusion of Asian characters by cramming as many as they can into this one movie. We will see what the future has in store for Shang-Chi and characters of color in the MCU.Overall, I really can't complain too much about this film. Some of the special effects (in particular the ""blast"" sound effects attributed to the rings) are over the top, but the CGI in general is stellar, and the setting and costumes are fun and fresh. The fight scenes in particular are great. The presence of the character Katy is a bit cliché to the superhero genre; she felt a lot like the equivalent of Peter Parker's friend Ned in the Tom Holland Spiderman movies. That is, she really only serves the purpose of being the protagonist's best friend and because of that is capable of doing things she otherwise wouldn't be capable of doing, for the sake of the plot. It would have been cool if Shang-Chi instead had a sensei-like teacher to guide him (as is the case with Liam Nesson's Raz al Ghul in Batman Begins), but I guess that role is played by his dad during flashback scenes. After all, this isn't really an origin story. I also would have liked to see them do more with Shang-Chi's sister, because she doesn't get nearly as much screen time and character development as he does. Some of the humor fell flat, but, as I said in the disclaimer, I watched the Spanish dubbed version, so maybe it's actually funnier in the original English. In conclusion, Shang-Chi exceeded my expectations, and I will likely be watching it again in the near future.",2 October 2021
aidofar, Move Disney than Marvel,This movie felt more Disney than Marvel. I enjoyed it but felt the CGI and second part of the movie let it down. The fight scenes in the first half of the film were excellent and then it got silly in the second part. Maybe worth waiting for it to appear on Disney + or DVD.,12 September 2021

esilvamarco, Marvel's Cultural Reset,"Shang-Chi was a great surprise! Didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. It is ranked high up amongst other Marvel's great blockbusters! Only had good things to say about this film. Great visuals, beautiful landscapes, action-packed scenes as well as the martial arts were the best ever captured on the big screen. The film felt authentic to the Chinese culture and the cast were perfect. The predominantly Asian & Asian-American cast shows an important step forward towards cultural representation in these big budget blockbuster films, and it's nice to not only see Asian characters presented with none of the all-too-common stereotypes. It was also great to see moments that allowed for strong women to have their time to shine without it feeling forced . The comedic moments and timing were spot on and added even more flavour to this great film.A great start to Phase 4. Look forward to seeing these new characters and stories furthered in future Marvel movies.",7 September 2021

However, Awkwafina's acting and/or character wasn't needed past the first act. She seemed out of place and shoehorned in much of the film. Her voice and presence was annoying.

jsy-54887, Thank you Marvel for taking this risk!,"This was a risk making a movie starring a mostly Asian cast, and i have to say that it paid off! Simu Liu was truly perfect casting! He not only got the essence of the character, making him relatable and likeable, but it seemed that he helmed much of the action scenes. There were multiple wide shots of hand to hand combats that absolutely blew my mind. I could not stop smiling!The director did an absolutely fantastic job leading this film. I just wished the 2nd act of the movie was paced a bit quicker. There was some set up during the second act that I wish perhaps came at the beginning. But this is a very very minor critique, and it may just be a me thing.All in all, this is the type of movie I want to pay to see.

MoviePeek, An absolute blast,"Marvel has proven over the past 13 years that they're able to take any character no matter how obscure or outlandish and give them a franchise that people are eager to see. Everything from a motley crew of galactic misfits to a man with shrinky powers, nothing is off-limits. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings this time introduces audiences to the titular character who simply has spectacular martial arts abilities. Compared to some of his big-screen peers Shang-Chi's USP and skill set may sound simplistic, but the truth is far from it.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings sees Shang-Chi try to escape his villainous father and his criminal empire and to instead live a normal simple life. Of course, this doesn't go to plan, and he must fight his father and the members of his shady organization. It is my pleasure to report that the film is a thrilling adventure that entertains from start to finish, delivering some of the best action scenes in the MCU to date as well as a surprising number of laughs. That's not to say the film is a comedy akin to Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor: Ragnarok, but its moments of levity come at the appropriate moments and land well.The master of kung-fu Shang-Chi is played by Simu Liu, who does an excellent job not only at the spectacular fight scenes but also in the scenes in which his fits are not colliding with a deadly ninja's jaw. In direct opposition to his father, Shang-Chi is a laid-back everyman with no grand ambition for his life. He's happy with his low-level job and loves a night out with his friends, not to mention the karaoke. He's charming and funny, and a welcome addition to the Marvel universe.Speaking of martial arts, you may be wondering; hang on, doesn't everyone in the marvel movies do some variation of martial arts? From Black Widow to Captain American, they're all capable fighters, is Shang-Chi really that much better? The answer is simply yes. Shang-Chi more than delivers when it comes to the fight scenes. Delivering tense, flowing, spectacular grounded fights that are a highlight of the film. They were truly fantastic, creative, and more than worth repeat viewings.If you've seen the trailer for the film, you'll know the film promises a lot, if you haven't, I won't ruin anything here, but if you're worried too much has been given away rest easy knowing that the film is stuffed with surprises and twists that will both shock and amaze you.It's no secret that Marvel heroes are likable and the films they're in spending a lot of time making the audience care about them, with a rich backstory and motivations anyone can empathize with. This is however often at the cost of the villain, who can sometimes prove to be underwhelming. Underdeveloped and unsympathetic they are more often than not the weakest part of the otherwise enjoyable movie. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings introduces Xu Wenwu aka The Mandarin, the leader of The Ten Rings, a word concurring criminal organization, in addition to being the wielder of the ten rings, ten mystical powerful rings which he wears as bracelets. The Mandarin is played by Hong Kong superstar Tony Leung Chiu-wai and is one of the film's greatest strengths and one of the best Marvel villains to date. He's bad for sure and does terrible things but he's not a mustache-twirling cartoon, he has believable motivations and is given ample screen time to develop into a complex character that any audience can emphasize. In addition to that, he is father to Shang-Chi, making their relationship complex and interesting.The finale ups the stakes in spectacular fashion, swapping out the grounded fights that have come before for something altogether grander. I found this to be one of the most entertaining and thrilling sequences of the film, but others may have different sensibilities and not feel the same. For me, however, it totally worked and undoubtedly one of the crazier things Marvel has done.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings introduces audiences to a new character and a whole new corner of the Marvel universe, both of which are fleshed out and unlike anything that has come before. In addition to this the characters, both good and bad are equally pleasing with great motivation and rich backstories. Its connections to the wider universe are there, which will please many people, but the film more than stands on its own. It's true that before Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings many of the audience will have never heard of Shang-Chi before, but after they won't be able to stop talking about him.",18 October 2021

limqiaoye, 8.0/10 ; ill add 1 bcos i love tony leung ;),"The movie feels rich in general; it feels steeped in culture, elements of Chinese culture brought to stunning life with bits and pieces of backstory filled in via deftly deployed flashback. Furthermore, the storyline is poignant and heartbreaking; you feel for wenwu, the acclaimed ""villian"" and his quest not for world dominance or anything else petty but instead to save the life of his wife, who he believes is trapped in a pocket dimension. There was also not a single character out of place, awkwafina was a rare sidekick that provided comedic relief at the beginning of the film, transitioning into an integral part of the final conflict and partner for shang-chi. This storyline is distinct in its nature to focus on the development of familial bond and all of the characters, showing that each character is complex and layered. ++ (one of my favourite scenes was during shang-chi's quest to stop his father from inadvertently releasing a demonic, soul-eating monster on the world, the cinematography accurately juxtaposed the tension between shang chi and his father against the still atmosphere of the backdrop, making us understand wenwu's heartbreak though his actions are reprehensible, a part of us still wants to believe in his cause of action. )however, the filmography for shang-chi's fight was a little disappointing. From the slanted angle of sweeping foot here to the breathless acrobatics of a flip there that dances between life and death, it is apparent that shang-chi shows its awareness to do that, but falls short in showing a real sense of stake that were grounded and tactile. For example, during the fight between wenwu and leiko, scenes of their fights were slowed down at parts, not for the sake of magnifying the fight between them but rather for a sense of coolness. Not only does this make the scene feel crafted artificially, it downplays the experience of physicality that it could have bring to the viewers. Hence, its ambition to become a kung fu marvel movie became a marvel movie w kung fu in it :(nonetheless, shang chi n the legend of ten rings was a martial arts fantasy that provided wit, heart and action to spare.",11 October 2021
nobledan31, Marvel kept it simple and made it perfect!!,Disney Marvel has a perfect way of simplifying the comic books into something a non-comic book reader can understand and follow along with.

tracemarkhome, Not worthy,"Not particularly impressed with the latest Marvel offering as it was bereft of any immersive storyline. Trevor was an unnecessary inclusion and, along with Wong, felt like they were simply there as a reminder of the good old days, or 'have some familiarity while you bear with us until we get things back on track'.The worst part however was the latest reminder of the Hollywood insistence that movies require a comic relief. Katy is a terribly written character, who tags along with nothing to offer and is actively encouraged to do so. She is portrayed by an unconvincing actress who would be better suited to lightweight teen comedies where constant OMG! Facial expressions are warranted.I have serious doubts for the longevity of the studio now that the ""big guns"" have all but been phased out.",11 November 2021

I was largely disinterested in the dramatic scenes as I found the a little sitcomy feeling, which is fitting as both Simu Liu and Awkwafina have backgrounds in tv comedy series' , but it unfortunately left most of the drama feeling flat in my experience, I did find the action scenes and general sense of style (especially in the first act) to be quite commendable. Despite my general disinterest with the dramatic scenes I found the emotional climax to be quite compelling and well handled, so for these reasons I would recommend the movie to anyone who based on the promotional material is interested in seeing it, but I find myself weary to recommend anyone who found the promotional material to be disengaging as I did, as overall the movie was in my experience, just okay.",10 September 2021

nktamim, Average,"The majesty and sanctity of love has been beautifully portrayed and some good work have been shown. I will talk a little about those without review. In fact, there is nothing for giving reviews of these movies. At first it is shown that Sang-chi's father means Wenyu goes to attack a fort and wins. We are actually familiar with the situation where Marvel means a huge arrangement, it seemed to me like a sorted toy. Although VFX is good for everyone, the animals in that village seem to me like the anime 'How to Train Your Dragon'.Bigger than that is that a little more detail about the village should have been shown. Somehow Marvel avoided that. And so much speculation for the village of these few houses? And where did so many people come from to pray their respects to the last few survivors? That's why I said Marvel need the village a little detailing.Although I would like to talk about a few other minor issues, I do not want to say. After waiting for two months, I did not get what I expected. And to be honest, VFX didn't bother me much. I think it would be better not to see it with more . To me, it's average.",12 November 2021

owenlong-52387, Tony Leung upgrades it to another level! Actions are good.,"I am not interested in popcorn movies at all. However, when I knew that Tony Leung is one of the main cast. I gave my last chance to Marvel.The fight scenes mix with styles from Ip Man, Kung-Fu...., this movie reached 80% of the standard. Especially for the fight between Wen-Wu and his wife.(Which is shown in the trailer)Also the plot is better than normal MCU movies. At least there is a all-round character description for Shang-Chi and other role players. Fair performance from every actor. However, Tony Leung(Wen-Hu) shown why he is the best actor of Cannes. Every move, eye-contact, voice is well-designed. He creates WenWu himself. (It has to give credit to the director also) He shown the reason why WenWu did those bad things.After all, Shang-Chi is a superhero movie. Description would not be detailed as the movie which Tony Leung casted normally. However, as one of the Tony's fan. It is a breakthrough for him. He seemed enjoyed from the interviews. Hope can see the background of WenWu in another movie.",6 September 2021

chelseababy-232-46106," Great movie, great acting","It's a story about love, have courage to respond to your calling, and letting go. Great acting and the whole package of the whole movie is awesomely done. Though I don't think the marketing of the film is good, for almost zero campaign regarding this film is seen prior it debute. Another thing worth mention is Chinese people just won't fight or even threaten to ""kill"" his/her parent, not to mention to even fight in front of parent's tomb. Marvel could have avoid the fighting thing in the shrine, since Chinese culture just won't allow anything disrespectful the ancestors at all.The story line of wenwu(Tony Leung), his character and his love towards his son and daughter is obvious, and Leung did a great job acting as a Chinese stubborn strict father who's afraid his legacy will be lost and desperately want to build an empire to conquer all. He loved his son and let his son do whatever he wanted for ten years. And though he had it all, wenwu realized he can never get over his wife and he wanted to see her so badly, he became delusional and knowing it's not possible but still wanted to break the gate in Talo.The story of why Webwu is like this is solid. But shangchi wise, is not. The movie would be better if shangchi showed a bit of affection towards wenwu and his sister. Also, in ancient Chinese society, women often has to learn to play music, sewing, or painting and play chess. Shangchi's sister could have done other stuff, rather than peeping aside and not being able to learn anything in her childhood, since Wenwu supposed to love her as well. In regards of wenwu's power and money, it shouldn't be hard to find his offsprings proper tutor.CGI wise is intriguing, you will see some characters from ancient Chinese Shan hai jing. It pretty much like Jurassic park in Marvel universe.Btw, we need more Tony Leung in Hollywood.",13 September 2021

The Philosophy of Maya which is unexplored in films from Indian subcontinent despite having the origins from the same and Hollywood doing justice to the dogma, oh boy, I am thrilled.

It's original, has a great story, good screenplay, excellent fight scenes WITH the actors (not stuntmen), the villain has a unique agenda (not just to kill the hero or take over the world), the origin story is told perfectly, the superpower (the rings) is really interesting, and the music is fantastic. It finally bumped Iron Man down to #2 on my MCU list.",6 September 2021
TheToday, It's okay,"I'm a strong MCU fan and I'm one of those who enjoy almost everything out there. If there's a bad movie that's fun I'm gonna enjoy it anyway. And I've enjoyed Shang-Chi. And I've laughed, many times.The problem is... I don't know. It doesn't really feel like a Marvel one to me, which doesn't need to be a bad thing but in this case, at least for me, it's not an advantage. It feels like an average Chinese ""kung fu + over-fantastic-Asian-mithology"" one. Gosh, they spend at least the first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie speaking Chinese. True, true, the trailer already sold us that style, but it's way further than what the trailer shows. I'm not a particular fan of that style of movies myself but I did give it a go because... Well, you know. It's Marvel. But it doesn't feel like Marvel, and I only believed that it is because of one small cameo in the middle of the movie, because of the last scene and because of the middle-credits one.That's the thing. If Shang-Chi wasn't a Marvel one, I don't believe I'd seen it at all because, as I said, Chinese fantasy-kung fu movies are not my thing, so I guess that's on me.But yeah. It was fun nevertheless.",3 September 2021
salonzoperez, Ten rings are too hot to handle,"Well, what can I say? I love anything Asian lol. I've waited so long to see Awkwafina be romantically involved with a Marvel superhero!! Shang-Chi is really worth the wait and mind you, it's nothing cheesy but I love the whole plot- cars, arrows, dragons, and Ben Kingsley! It's simply a complicated magical family affair.But the most interesting question is... how does this specific event connect us to a point in time in the Marvel universe?",12 November 2021
mattrimble, Pretty good,A marvel movie with dragons and martial arts I liked the story and thought the vfx were really good.,10 October 2021
ghostsm, Good movie if you don't expect it to be like the comic,"First off ,Tony Leung steals the movie. He's great as Shang-Chi's father and the head of Ten Rings (and not the Mandarin) .The movies starts as kind of Jackie Chan style action flick and morphs into kind of Kaiju movie. Kind wish it remain a straight kung fu movie. Not a big fan how the finally scenes is huge CGI fight. I guess it wouldn't be an MCU movie without a CGI fight.I felt the inclusion of Wong was little force in the middle of the movie.",22 September 2021
emiliejac, Amazing,"I loved this movie! Easy to follow along with the story, great scenes and it was even quite funny. I was either looking amazed or smiling throughout the entire movie.",9 September 2021
namie-98193, Low expectation,"Went in with low expectation, of maybe cultural butchering or what not. Came out infatuated with Wenwu. Where did all the serious talent like Tony Leung go at international stage??! This is also the first Marvel film that felt very Disney to me. The brand is there. Overall the story is great especially till the father vs son fight. The chinese dragon, and lions? Delicious choice, love it! But, the CGI monsters as main climax villain... yuck. What a boooooring turn of events. Booo Disney and your boring aliens and the unknown are bad. Oh, like 100 years ago, ooh Asians bad cause they are so alien, anything alien baaaaad. Main bad.",4 November 2021
shahar-zivan, Nauseatingly formulaic,"I know, I know... It's an MCU origin story - of course it's gonna be formulaic. They all have been up to this point.But... maybe I'm just tired of it at this point. Maybe I've had too much. This one just felt *so* by-the-numbers that I could literally predict everything that happens in a scene, as soon as it started - and I wasn't even trying.My brain just did it completely on its own - ""oh I bet now they're gonna argue and the argument will be interrupted by bad guys attacking"", etc. Every time.It just made the movie very hard to enjoy.I'm still giving it a 6 because, if you're not already overly familiar with the Marvel formula it might be pretty fun, and the actors do a good job, the martial arts scenes are pretty cool, the jokes are okay and the characters are likable. It also makes sure to have lots of easter eggs and references to previous MCU titles, to keep you entertained.So there's enough decent stuff to put it in the higher half of the rating options. But just barely.",27 November 2021
vaughanroisin," Good plot, good humour and good acting","Amazing performance from Simu Liu. So glad that the first Asian led film was such a success, hopefully it paves the way for many more.Plot line was excellent, can easily be watched as a standalone, while still connecting with the MCU for ultra-fans.",11 September 2021
peter-graat, A very pleasant surprise,"I will be honest. After the previews of this film I was not very enthusiastic. I didn't know this character from the Marvel universe either.When the movie started I quickly got a ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" vibe. And I didn't mind at all, since that has been my favorite Asian movie for a long time.The film tells a beautiful story, does it with sense and humor and the fantastic special effects that are characteristic of Marvel.I quickly felt a bond with the three protagonists. And even the bad guy I could sympathize to a certain extent.When the film was over I noticed that I immediately thought that this story could go much further.I hope for a sequel!",14 November 2021
hyukkyukim, My all time favorite marvel movie,"Easily my favorite MCU movie now. The martial art scenes were very intense and entertaining and I had no problem with the marvel cgi thing. The story was great, the character development was great, and the relationship between shaun and his father's relationship developed very well.",21 October 2021
nelsonmd-62036, It's not another worst movie (and there's no annoying overuse scene),"Watch it for the action scenes, because that is all there is. Forget about the story and wait for the next fight. The underlying story is unoriginal and uninspired. I understand Disney did this to get a pat on the back, but they need to slow down and focus on making better movies.",24 February 2022
Drebe73, I absolutely loved Shang-Chi. A Favorite or thr MCU,"This was a fun, thrilling, funny, emotional ride. From the acting to the cinematography to the effects, I can't commend the creators enough.

snehalsury, Dragon in the plot line yet again.,"So tired of this creature appearing in plot lines by now. Felt there is nothing original in the story, very predictable story. Not very strong performances from most actors. The lead was great but the rest of the cast felt lackluster.",14 November 2021
frednagyfn, Just another superhero movie,"Unfortunately its just another dime-a-douzen superhero movie.Nothing is different with this one, typical predictable story, cool cgi and thats about it.Cgi good like they usually are for these types but personally thats all there is.You can predict the next scene before it starts and you can predict the ending perfectly on point if you've been watching superhero movies.Has for Shang-Chi, theres nothing different. I got bored half way through and came back just for the ending. Wasn't impressed all that much.I think these should be released directly to streaming platforms. That would be a better fit.",1 October 2021
Zielke9, Mediocre at best.,"The movie was boring and unsurprising. There was never a time that I had to worry about any of the characters. About 95% of the movie was predictable and the only thing that really surprised me is that they didn't kill of either of the white characters. The sister was entirely unnecessary and another marvel Mary Sue. Every time she was on screen, all tension was lost.If marvel wrote female characters as competent people who can sometimes fail, it would make for a more compelling story, but as long as they have to push female empowerment messages like they are trying to break through to people still living in the 1920's, it will always come off as boring and unnecessary. How did the dragon go from being super powerful to all of a sudden super weak everytime they wanted the sister to participate?Akwafina was annoying but sometimes a little funny. I would go back and fourth between liking her character and not liking her character at all. If they kept akwafina and didn't have the sister or if the sister had faults and they took out akwafina, it would have made for a much better story.And no one likes captain marvel aside from about 1% of the entire marvel fan base, including the actors. Why do they keep trying to shove her into end credit scenes when she just makes people more disappointed everytime she's on screen?Why is banner's arm in a sling? Hulk prevents him from getting seriously injured, so it just doesn't make sense.These woke writers need to start paying attention to the source material and stop making up rules as they go.",18 November 2021
samcochran-032401, An Incredible Movie Ruined By One Character,Incredible special effects. Incredible action sequences that stand out in the MCU. Incredible back story to Shang-Chi. Everything is incredible until Katy starts talking. There was no need for her character. She wasn't funny. If this movie didn't have her it would've been one of the top 10 MCU movies ever made. Everything good about the movie barely makes up for how much her character sucks.,3 September 2021
nathanmcdougle, If felt like a Disney movie,"It felt like at at any moment Eddie Murphy was going to pop in. But in the absence of that slap stick an adequate side kick is there. For some this is ok. However, this is Marvel or at least it was at some point. It's watered down into something that is not within the MCU. Not saying don't watch it. Please do. But after you watch it it doesn't leave you coming back for more. It would take an act of Congress to get me to watch a sequel. I'd rather watch Will smith make a come back in Aladdin 2, the Human adventures.",1 January 2022

btwjonathan, Good film,"The vibe of the film is just so nice and I don't know why. Action scenes were great especially the martial arts. Good villain, you understand why he does those bad things. There is also humor in the film but it always stops at the right moment. So yeah it's a lot better than black widow.",7 September 2021

leanne-elizabeth, Wow!!,"I've just come out of the cinema and I'm in awe of how beautiful this movie was. It was visually stunning: rich in colour and graphics. The costumes, cinematography and set were outstanding. The music was wonderful. There were funny moments, heart felt moments and edge of your seat moments. Everything that a Marvel movie should be and more. It made me so happy to see the Asian community finally being represented in the Marvel universe. Acting was insane. I absolutely love Akwafina. Go and watch this at the cinema if you can- it is so worth it to see the beauty on the big screen.",11 September 2021

ijustlovetowatch," 9/10 stars for the first half of the film, 0/10 FOR CGI DISNEY CREATURES","For the first half of the film, I really thought Marvel had nailed it. The production felt very Marvel-like with spectacular visuals and effects, alongside an emotional development of the plot that draws you in greatly. It was amazing, I would give the first half a 9/10 for the story and character development. The story-building is done so beautifully with amazing cinematography and fight choreography. I really felt the chemistry between characters and began to invest in their relationships and root for them in the very beginning. The movements in action-based scenes flow so smoothly but powerfully that it was such a joy to watch. The family drama in the first half is convincing and emotionally wrecking, I'm so glad MCU invests in the villain Wen-wu (Tony Leung)'s story as much as Shang-Chi's.However, the CGI towards the end of the film (when they arrive at the village of Ta Lo) RUINED IT for me. Magical creatures are involved and the whole thing becomes Disney-like and more like a teenage/young adult fantasy film than a Marve film. The design of the creatures felt very Disney: the 'good' creatures are fluffy and cute, the 'evil' creatures look like - clichely - bats and spiders etc. The story here is still okay - not the best but definitely logical enough to enjoy. The worst is the battle between CGI creatures and humans... During the climactic point where Shang-Chi was fighting along with the dragon, I was reminded of Harry Potter and his adventures. Tbh the dragons in HP's The Goblet of Fire felt even much more dangerous and exciting than the creatures in this film. The CGI creatures and their interactions with the humans in this film are that BAD. I feel greatly disappointed in MCU because of this, making the whole atmosphere of the film more Disney than MCU. I love innovations and creativity but I came here to watch a Marvel film instead of a Disney film. I really would prefer them to focus more on Shang-Chi vs. Wen-wu in the final battle. I was invested in both characters so much I wish I could've seen more of them.",6 October 2021

slickpit101, Enjoyed it Awkwafina is still unbearable,I enjoyed the movie but she is very cringe. If she hadn't been in it maybe a 9/10! Of the more recent movies this has definitely been my favorite. I would definitely recommend it.,13 November 2021
binaratmaja," Martial Arts, Disney, Raya and The Dragon,Powerfull father that die in 10 seconds","Shang-chi review : spectacular visual wonder
My rating : 8.5/10
Cast & performances :
The film has Simu Liu in top form. He is your ordinary guy but extraordinary powers and actor blends into the character well - with not a single false note. Giving him good company are actresses Awkwafina who is effortless in whatever she does and Meng'er Zhang who also performs some mind-numbing stunts.The star of the film of course is veteran actor Tony Leung- a father who wants to bring back his family together but also is aware of his extraordinary powers. It's his love for his dead wife that makes him tough and cold towards his children. Years back Leung had charmed the world with his subtle style in Wong Kar Wai's 'In The Mood For Love'. Decades later, Leung has aged like fine wine and it's a delight to watch him play the antagonist with such style.Ben Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh too make their presence felt in the limited screen time they have.Technical values :
Shang-Chi scores high on its technical front. Each and every craft excels in giving a thoroughly enjoyable superhero action flick. The top-class VFX take the audience into a world of mythical adventure. The cinematography, production design and background score are top-notch.Shang-Chi, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, attempts to shake up the Marvel formula by infusing it with martial-arts action and fairy-tale fantasy and grounding it in Chinese and Asian American culture. And while its disparate elements don't meld together as smoothly as they should, they do, in the end, add up to a superhero movie fresh and fun enough to feel worth a spin"".Shang Chi's strength lies in balancing itself. For every high octane action sequence, there's a back story to get you readjusted to your seat. The amazingly choreographed fights will bring you to the edge of your seats and at the same time, you can't help but groove to the peppy background score. There are so many good songs on their list.Apart from music, Marvel once again excels in terms of CGI. The graphics are so compelling that you don't regret stepping inside a cinema hall in times of a pandemic. They're worth it.Highlights :
Cast & Brilliant performances
Stunning top notch visual effects
Extraordinary High Octane Action Stunts

Terrific Background Score
Good story and DirectionOverall : Adventurous ride into a mythical world.",23 September 2021
aholejones, If they make a sequel I shangt chi it.,"Honestly I think a lot of these Marvel superhero movies are vastly overrated and this is no exception. A friend of mine asked if I wanted to join him in the theater and I said 'Very well I shang chi it with you!'. All jokes aside I wish I hadn't. It's just too lengthy for such a mediocre story and movie. They wallow way too much in the boring and uninteresting family drama of the family Shang-Chi. We get it they have daddy issues no need to hammer it in every other scene. Also we get it they are asian without cramming in every single asian stereotype like dragons in there. Also I feel kind of bad for Shang-Chi for training all his life and then his peeping tom sister just looks at them training from the shadows and just spins and twirls some chains around alone like she is training for the upcoming rhythmic gymnastics meet only to become much better at fighting than his brother and everyone else there despite them engaging in hard sparring and having personal guidanceetc. , but that's just how it is, girls can do anything guys can and not only that they can do it better.",20 January 2022
ShuhratGlazkov," Starts as a strong martial arts movie but ends as a cliche, formulaic Marvel movie.","I really liked how the movie started and went in a certain direction for like the first hour but after that point, the movie suddenly becomes a lot more mystical and decides to sway from its direction which did more harm than good to the movie in my opinion. By the end, I just wanted to watch some cool looking, well choreographed hand-to-hand fight scenes but what I got was characters ""kamehameha""ing each other and gigantic beasts fighting along. But I guess I can't complain, I knew what I was going to get since this is a MCU movie after all.",7 September 2021
ariazarei2004," Fun, interesting special effects, a little bored","The film was interesting and, of course, action, which can be fun and of course has its own fans, but from time to time the film gets a little bored, it can't be said that it had powerful actors, but it was enough for their roles, it was very imaginative and special effects were pleasant, the content of the film was relative and the film had a good ending that is very attractive to the viewer, but I expected more and couldn't get the original demand.

russallen-10998, Sometimes they just get it right,"MCU have scored another hit and rightly so.

Looking forward to where this takes us within MCU.",8 October 2021
dfjk-90360, Cringe-worthy caricatural racial stereotyping,"I'm really not a fan of ""Awkwafina"" and the racial stereotyping she represents. That's her whole schtick: she plays a caricatural racial stereotype, one that is apparently meant to elicit laughter in some quarters.She's a caricature of a racial stereotype the way Aunt Jemima or black boy lawn decorations were - perhaps endearing to some, but quite an unappealing and cringe-worthy racial stereotype to others.And what's with having a director of Japanese background in charge of a movie about a Chinese character? I'm guessing some movie executives figured ""What's the difference, they're all the same to us.""Sure the two countries are more or less in the same geographic proximity, and the people have some similar appearance, at least to outsiders, but the cultures are quite different and the two countries aren't even exactly on the best of terms.So that's like putting an Israeli director in charge of a movie about Syria or Iran, a British director in charge of a movie about France, or a Turkish director in charge of a movie about Greece.This is probably the Marvel movie that I enjoyed the least, and I certainly don't understand the IMDB rating that somehow shows 7.5 at the moment - it is most definitely not worth anywhere near that.Not impressed.",12 December 2021

benhallett, Marvels dragon ball z,"This film was everything it needed to be and more, let's be honest no one had high expectations for this film but marvel once again raises the bar. First the film is simply stunning for the moving forest at the start, to the character visual designs it was truly immersive. Where the film truly shines though is the action scenes, the way they shot the scene on that bus from someone that appreciates films was MIND BLOWING! The one take where he's fighting across the broken in half bus was amazing very similar to daredevil.Marvel also had a great villain in the mandarin with a very relatable reason for his actions and not just wants the kill everyone. Comedy held up very well from the supporting cast the plane scene when there pronouncing his name was something out of rush hour and I loved it.The final act of the film was when I worried the most as I knew a CGI fest was coming but the action was simply the best I've ever scene. Riding a dragon and doing a dragon ball z blast with the rings it literally gave me goose bumps and actually hit emotion notes for me in the family issues department when he confronts his dad saying ""is this what you wanted"" when they are fighting next To the river. As a stand-alone film this probably works better but as a whole I am overly impressed with this film and I know people who understand film writing and shooting will know how amazing marvel are and have just performed 👍",5 September 2021
matilda-79276, Breathtaking,This movie was so beautifully made that I cried from just pure excitement. I had forgotten what it was like to watch an action movie so well written and executed that it didn't need comedy every other second to distract you from the plot.,1 September 2021
patbornotb, Even giving 4 stars is too much,"Just a mess, starts good but soon gets in fairy tale land. Has the usual stop to have a heart to heart in the middle of a battle. More a poor take on Lord of the Rings for Chinese viewers, no offense meant. If it had just been a better movie, slow middle and poor ending. The trailer is far better than the movie. Don't waste you time, life is short, something that this film isn't.",1 December 2021
victorknazkins-34741, Mediocre,"To sum up this movie, I can say it wasn't imposing. The characters did not feel entirely fleshed out, and the plot is just the usual formula of a hero action-adventure movie. Unfortunately, it does not cover personal growth and overcoming obstacles. Furthermore, many plot conveniences push the story, rather than progressing and including the conveniences as something accidental.This movie does not feature any known Marvel characters and does not make the audience invested in the newly introduced ones. Also, the film feels the need to make something epic happen on screen. After Avengers Endgame, the Marvel franchise needs to one-up themselves. Therefore the antagonists of the movie seem a bit artificial and do not deliver a convincing reason for doing what they do.In conclusion, this movie is mediocre at best and does not deserve a watch.",10 March 2022
mattchis, Best Marvel film for a while,"To be honest, I'd sort of gone off everything Marvel and the super hero genre as a whole. Against popular opinion, the avengers films don't do it for me. Everything had started to feel a bit repetitive and uninspiring. Probably the last Marvel film I enjoyed was Ragnarok and I'm not a fan of the recent tv shows either. God knows what DC are doing.This however was a really fun film with outstanding fight scenes and generally stunning cinematography. The characters are likeable and relatable in a way. There's a good blend of well written humour which hits better than the recent Marvel films in my opinion. It was action from start to finish, but the backstory was woven in well throughout the film with flashback scenes. The way they blended the flashback scenes with the present was really well executed.The only critique I have is that the Liverpudlian fella definitely doesn't have a Liverpool accent. Otherwise it would be a 10/10. Just kidding, I don't care and if they made him scouse we'd need more subtitles.Overall the film was a lot of fun. It takes a proven formula, nails it, then adds a few mythical creatures into the mix. The story is fairly basic as you expect from these types of films, but as a pure action/adventure film it was brilliant, which is why I've given it a 9.",14 December 2021
thatsugaraddict, It was not the greatest,"The story wasn't too bad. I didn't understand his sidekick, she was annoying and kind of ruined the movie for me. I didn't see the need to have her in there. The fighting was subpar. Totally predictable especially people with weapons. You could tell when the swing was gonna happen and where it was gonna be placed. They need better choreography.",23 December 2021
solomediag, Upsetting because it was so close to being good,"Some good action scenes, but almost all of them are interrupted by out of place gags like the IG Live guy and Awkwafina for the rest of the movie. Really hard to stay invested because of that. It gets serious for a long stretch in the third act (where it crams all the character development), but the goofiness of the multiple buttons robs what could have been a decent ending of any impact. The characters are left totally unaffected by the events of the film making you question whether they are sociopaths.",6 September 2021

I didn't get as emotionally involved with the characters or as fearful of the stakes, as I have in other Marvel films.I watch a good deal of martial arts flicks too, and I have to say the fight-choreography and editing is top notch, good work by stunt and fight coordinators all round.",12 November 2021

mannatpandit, 'Greatest solo super hero film from Marvel.'😀🤑,"One of best solo hero films from marvel. Good action last 30 minutes are bang on. Martial arts action in whole film. Nice story. Emotional combo, binds you in the story. Nice cast, acting, bang on. Sound tracks are good. Vfx are good. Post credit scenes are good.",4 September 2021
sapnesh-41075," Its okay, but not great","Plot is expected, acting was okay. But overall, the movie was not so great.",3 September 2021
annalisetiley," Forced many things, but good","The accents were pretty bad in this movie, and I'm talking about the English accents; they were very forced and honestly the whole movie should have just been in Chinese, that would have been 10x better. The poor English speaking kind of threw off a lot of lines for me, making the lines in English feel forced and cringey. It was just super random too, like in the most randomest times. The movie was also a little boring, and the plot was a little forced as well, but the ending was pretty predictable yet good. Honest rating for the whole thing a 5/10, I liked Awkwifina's (forgive me if I spelled her name wrong) part in the movie.",5 October 2021
danielfnemes, And I thought Captain Marvel was bad,"Typical Chinese fantasy/martial arts movie. Way too long and boring, unoriginal story, poor acting, even the CGI has a few misses (bus scene).Easily the worst Marvel movie until now.",13 November 2021
samuelsoliman-34620, Great Marvel Movie,"Great movie. Lots of surprises. The plot isn't predictable. Main characters are great. Love the fight scenes - not gratuitous but well choreographed and entertaining. Multidimensionality of the antagonists is intelligent. Sir Ben's role is humorous. Post credits are great. Great dynamic between Shang and Katy. Can't wait to see where this leads next. Marvel needs to continue in this trajectory as opposed to other directions of inclusivity, which end up being exclusionary to many people.",16 November 2021
chows-55430, I can't remember when I've enjoyed a movie more!,"I'm burned out on the Marvel and DC universes, but saw this on a seatmate's screen on a flight and was entranced immediately.

Oh yeah, did I mention I'm 70 years old?",16 January 2022
jwwoolbright, Fun but....,"I would say that I really enjoyed this movie I' mabe a big comic book fan ....but would say it would be a fun movie for action film lovers, if you are one that loves to watch the end
credit scene I don't think that there was much excitement was already predictable I'm used to the post credit scenes giving a surprise so other than that great movie !",17 November 2021
dalehitchy, I don't know why this movie is rated so highly,"It's not an awful film but it's not good either. I thought the plot was weak, so we're the characters. The animation was okay but weak in points. It's definatly not in the league of other marvel films.",1 October 2021
constelaciondelyra, Forgettable movie,"The only saving grace of the movie is perhaps the Eastern flavour that brings to superhero movies. This is otherwise bland, with no memorable story or performances, no strong heros or villains.

tony-kenny81, Better than externals. That's not saying much,I don't get the MCU anymore. They've made more terrible films than they have good movies. This was better than the eternals but that's really not saying that much. Both movies are awful and should not be added to the MCU.Awkwafinas performance was probably the only fun thing in the movie and her presence made no sense to the story. Watch Spiderman instead. That's a movie they actually cared enough about to make something decent. This was just thrown together to try to appeal to as many audiences as possible. Same with black panther. The only difference be8mg that you could take out 20-30 mins of black panther and it would be totally amazing whereas this movie is just garbage.,31 January 2022
cardodavid, Pretty average and full of cliches,"This movie is full of cliches. Because it is with Chinese heroes it needs dragons, mafia, fights with an invader gang in the middle of the night, a martial arts master, the hippie-animal-lover village that is destroyed but the dressed in black city based brutes and others.",16 November 2021
tiancaipipi110, A good story and solid performance and directing.,"I didn't have any expectation and ended up quite enjoying the film. The story is solid, with only minor problems.

chaisesmith, Fine,"Terrific cast, fun character, and an enjoyable - if forgettable - story. This movie could/should have been solidly mid-tier MCU fare, but doesn't quite make it out of that Thor 2, IM 3 territory of MehCU.There are so many cool/positive things in this movie, that were just completely washed out by terrible pacing, weird story points (32 year old Simu, playing the world's oldest looking 26 year old), and criminally boring visuals. Seriously, who decides to make a super hero kung fu action flick, in which every fight is in shadow or being panned over/cut away from?Overall, there is enough fun just watching Simu and Awkwafina to make the movie fine if you're an MCU completionist, otherwise it's a safe skip.Bright Side: Simu as Shang-Chi seems like he's going to be a real fun character to add into the MCU, even if his debut is less than stellar.Alt Title: Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Thousand Flashbacks.",19 September 2021

shahrzadpendari, Acceptable,"I enjoyed watching Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings and the martial arts choreography is absolutely amazing, however the plot feels gimmicky and flat sometimes. Xialing learning martial arts all by herself from watching from 500 meters away? Awkwafina suddenly managing an accurate shot after a few hours of archery? And I wished we had more character development, I was waiting for the Dead Dealer (Whom I found fascinating) and Xialing to be explored more and have more dialogues but the former just got whacked by some soul sucking dragon in an absolutely lame fashion. The scripts is super cringe in many places, especially when the comic relief Katy/Awkwafina wants to joke. In general, its a fun movie to watch but don't try to analyze it too much.",11 November 2021
jejesicaa, Wow!,"What a great start for the Phase 4. Fresh, and has a strong character arc. Went over my expectations. Simu Liu seems fit and perfect for the role, alongside with the legends (Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh) making this movie much more enjoyable.Also, great scores! Overall, this is as good as Black Panther. Can't wait to see what happens next for Shang-Chi.And as Chinese-descendant, those ""asian parent trying to raise a perfect kid"" thing got me.PS: I recommend you guys watch it in cinema.",28 September 2021

akc-03850, I would be better if it was a series,"After watching this film we come to know that this film has been made in rush however it needs slow because as its title is The Legend it doesn't seem that it is a legend, almost 70 percent of the movie is not clear like film wants to show its audience because the screenplay is loose and the story is super mind blowing this is somewhat suspenseful which becomes clear in climax, film's background is as good as it should be, however it has been made in rush it is a good movie and it could have been better if it was made into two parts one with the legend of the rings and one with the soul predator.",19 April 2022
rwburkey-65775, Disney ruined this movie as did Awkwafina,"This movie could have been great. It has stellar choreography and visuals, but the character development, dialogue, and casting ruined the entire movie. Every 10 minutes, there is a loud pointless raspy comment made by Awkwafina. This ruined the entire movie. Almost every joke and line was forced and cringe.",18 November 2021
raghuvirab, One of the worst superhero movies out there,"I don't get the positivity around this trash. Right from the word go, something was wrong. It drags on with a ridiculous plot which is a mish-mash from other movies and ends in a ludicrous CGI battle and everyone goes awww and gave it 7.5 rating on imdb.... I just don't get it.Shang chi actor has no acting skills, no range of emotions, no appeal, and no screen-presence. He is just there waving his hands and legs, wearing a plot armorShang Chi's lady friend Awkwafina is annoying as hell. Her voice screeches. And they don't have any chemistry. What are they supposed to be? Friends? Or BF and GF?The bus sequence is ripped off from the movie Speed. The story where Awkwafina suddenly acquires archer skills is ripped off from Dragonheart. I am sure there are more. So what is it but a mish-mash of ripped off ideas from other moviesShang Chi's sister Xialing is irritating to watch. Her hair is dead black without any crease?? It's clearly a wig for crying out loud!! And she is thin to the bones and she can fight kung fu? Who the they kidding?The villains are dumb as hell too. Shang Chi's father after having lived for an eternity has aged just enough to be Shang Chi's father age, i.e 50s. Why couldn't he have been 24? And with all the experience he cannot figure out the spell he was under.And all the villains strike our protagonists head. I am screaming in my chair that... there is something called a chest and belly, just lower your hands and punch the guts and our hero is out. But no... They need to act as dumb as they look.And oh... that Chinese Wakanda. God it's a disgrace. The CGI, the animal design and the world design is utterly terrible. The world is too green and pulls you out of immersion. When ever the characters are walking in front of the green vegetation behind them, their head and the hairs gets blurry, highlighting the failure of the CGI when they tried to remove the green screen.Martial arts is nothing but punching the air and hand waviness. Just watch Kung Fu Panda 1 and Crouching Tiger Hidden DragonThe final boss fight is just cgi non-sense.I can go on and on but let me close on just one question.What is Shang Chi's powers? He's got none, until he gets those bracelets. So how can he take all the beating and still be in one piece? And all those skills on dragon surfing etc.I have to admit, if I have worn the fanboy glasses and kept my brain in the freezer I would have certainly liked it. But I did the opposite and see what happens :-(",8 January 2022
peterbunzl, Terrible script. Terrible cgi.,"So much backstory and exposition needed to cover way too much fantasy gubbins in the script. Awful cgi. Every scene has flat lighting and flat staging that make the characters look pasted into the surface. There are a few great scenes in the first half of the movie actually shot on location or sets with augmented effects, which kind of gave a feel of what it might've been, and a few moments where the actors are allowed to perform in a real location and their performances seem to have some anchor. Otherwise it felt a total mess.",3 December 2021
paulscott-18340, Good but not great,"Likeable main characters and with some fantastic action scenes, this is an overall solid film!

johnsuyuchu, Insulting and Unnecessary Details,"What is the purpose of having Ben Kingsley performing as Mandarin? Ironman Tony Stark is dead.

knyfhddmz," Its Formulaic, but the formula still WORKS","Marvel did it again. The formula is there, the action, the drama, the comedy, the well done CGI. Its a marvel movie, what else do you expect, its a good movie. But for me Tony Leung as Wen Wu overshadowed Simu Liu as Shang Chi. Leung is a GREAT actor, knew him since Infernal Affair, he brought the character of Wen Wu as best as no one else could, even when he stood without a dialogue you can feel his charisma.,., i'd go see the this again just to watch Wen Wu , Simu Liu has a long way ahead of him to be a better actor, but this one is OK.

mfriesen-96359, An all around great movie 👍,"This is a visually stunning movie. With great action scenes and fabulous fights. The Asian and Asian American representation hits home for me, being a half Asian Canadian. And the comedy is there, when needed.

Marvel really pulled all the stops in creating this masterpiece. The fight sequence between Xu Wenwu and Leiku Wu at the beginning was so stunning - fighting incorporated with dancing - it was truly wonderful. Can't wait to see this unravel onwards.

carlwilliamlindgren, Did we watch the same movie??,"I convinced my friend to go see this tonight based on the high score and positive reviews, but the movie turned out to be a real let down.Extremely predictable, no suprises whatsoever. The jokes never really landed for me and most the characters invovlved were there soly for comic relief. Hocus Pocus Jackie Chan martial arts scenes that has no anchoring in reality.Main antagonists motives were very unclear, did he simply go mad after 1000 years of sanity? And Main character learned how to use the rings better than his father after 10 seconds, what the actual? Very unlikable side-characters introduced, what were the studio thinking going into this?Very obvvious that they cramed in the monster fight at the end just to have visual spectable. Disney animals everywhere, this is without a doubt the most Goofy Marvel movie as of yet.Visual team did a great job though with the CGI, therefore 4/10.",10 September 2021
brianlo-15134, Tony Leung completely steals the show.,"I thought the storyline is fine. The Chinese (& unfortunately some Japanese) elements incorporated shows that they did a lot of research, and it didn't feel pandering. The set and the special effects during some fight scenes are absolutely stunning. I also thought the dialogues about remembering your roots and your name not only represents an important pillar of Chinese morals, but a timely message that a lot of immigrants can relate to.However, I think Tony Leung's acting completely stole the show, so much that it completely overshined Shang-Chi's story arc. From start to end, I was way more invested in his performance and his character, while his death felt rushed and left me wanting more. I also thought it's a pity that the sister's story arc got set aside for Awkwafina's, because it could be so important to Shang-Chi's character development.I thought the storytelling at the first half of the story is surprisingly captivating, and I wished the second half didn't lose that element to incorporate more fight scenes. But I enjoyed it overall.",5 September 2021

melanieseven, Exhilirating ride from start to finish,This movie is one of the best cinematic experiences I have had. It will live on as one of the best Marvel films ever.

TheUglyCasanova," Too much CGI, not enough everything else.","Another case of throwing so much CGI at you that it just gets old. There was a lot of good choreography ruined by it and turning the fights into ""okay stuff is happening.."" scenes instead. Sure some of it looked pretty, minus all the wonky creatures that didn't need to be there. Simu did a good job but the girl named after a brand of water is just horrible and unfunny just as she was in Jumanji.Not familiar with the comics but felt very unMarvel at the end by adding Neverending Story type dragon and then an overly long Kaiju battle? Top that off with the final boss being defeated as stupidly as the aliens in War of the Worlds and I can honestly say I'm not excited about this addition to the universe, especially with Water Brand girl staying from the looks of it..ugh.Definitely a low point of the newer entries in my opinion.",13 January 2022

""Present!"").I am very curious what the future will bring.Plus the music and the camera work was amazing (the camera dude did the Matrix too, so that's definitely a big win).Last but not least, I was afraid of the disconnection to the Avengers or other superheroes, but this was referring to our former and older Avengers in a very smart way.And at the very last; it left us with enough and good questions to keep us peaked for the upcoming films!",11 September 2021

Honestly don't know if is tight to chinese culture but look quite respectful to it imho. Also didn't know about the character before and the novelty didn't disappoint as instantly become one of the best heroes origin film both DC and Marvel of course. Most of the cast is unfamiliar to me but nothing that demerits the product, on the contraire quite surprised by the good performances. The figths are very well choreographed to the point to bring back the sensations of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The effects are so well made that is very hard to find a defect to complain about. Mostly flawless to me. Remarkable the smoothness of the water scenes. Nature and creatures scenes are very well done too. Beautiful scenes appears with some regularity. Sound is terrific too. Is a Marvel movie and conserve the tone of all the previous ones. Enjoyable, interesting, not dark, well paced and of course well done.

aninspiration, Rather surprising but still MCU,"At first, it felt like I am watching not a MCU movie: it felt just different.Clearly, Shang-Chi targets the China Market and invites us to embrace the Chinese culture and suddenly, I liked that part about the movie. I've watched few Chinese movies and yet I like this one a lot.Pros:
Cool action, scenes and music. Actually a decent plot. A thorough backstory (given the movie runtime).Cons:
What I really dislike in recent MCU movies is that there is always that one person who is damn silly and ridiculous but is never fun for me: they are always apparent and it's totally clear what's their role in the movie - to make you laugh by their silly jokes and them being sort of 'the third wheel'. I feel cringe. Sorry.Speaking of visuals and unique creations: it didn't impress me. Instead, it felt somewhat underwhelming. I am not saying it was terrible but I definitely seen better VFX production in the MCU and my expectations are higher than what we get in Shang-Chi.In conclusion, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings impressed me and at the same time slightly disappointed me.In the end, it was just a good one for me.",4 September 2021

mmr-93367, Major Corporation Ruins Local Businesses With 'Crouching Panda Hidden Dragon Warrior'.,"Well... this movie is far from my optimistic expectations and also far from my pessimistic expectations. In case you don't want to read the rest of it, it's not bad but it's still not really good. In case you want to however, just keep reading.Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is frankly an overrated mediocre formulaic Marvel solo origin movie that succeeds in terms of action because of course it does and a very formulaic yet fair job in terms of plot but fails a lot in terms of character.The action: at this point action scenes and choreography for these movies should only be noted if they are surprisingly awful. I mean like COME ON! A major studio owned by none other than Walt freaking Disney that has enough money to buy the sun itself makes a movie about martial arts in the 2020s and you expect anything but sheer awesomeness?! Oh don't get me wrong, it's marvelous (pun intended) how much passion, talent and hard work has gone through this.The plot: the plot of this movie is like the plot of Frozen II, Star Wars' sequel trilogy, No Time To Die and Captain Marvel. A plot that independently judged, isn't that bad. It has a narrative that isn't too full of plot holes and enough explanation and backstory to make it seem more grand. It even has some supposedly dark and emotional moments. HOWEVER, just like the titles named above, it really is in fact a formulaic plot put together seemingly by a bunch of marketers who wanted to sell a product more rather than tell a story. Almost every single plot point can be easily predicted 5 sequences beforehand. The majority of the first half's plot is alright though. The plot of the second half of the movie however is honestly shallow and empty because unlike the majority of the first half it needs the audience to care for the characters and that is really where the movie drops the ball.The characters: the characters in this movie are either really REALLY formulaic or they just don't do anything that would leave an impact. You got the protagonist, the dude this movie is named after, Shang-Chi, who despite being much more energetic than the posters and trailer thumbnails suggest is truly incomplete and by the end of the movie is yet to be properly introduced. Let's compare him with Ant-Man. In 2015's Ant-Man you get a decent story you might not fully remember a week later, you get a villain you might forget a day later and you might even argue that most of the supporting cast is also rather forgettable. What you can't deny though, is that the movie introduces you to Ant-Man. You know what he's mostly like and you know what impact certain events can have on him. In Shang-Chi for instance there is a scene where Shang reveals to ms. Comic relief that he actually went after the man responsible for his mother's death and killed him when he was still a teenager. Now this should've and would've been a fantastic character reveal if only we really knew what Shang-Chi is and was like and how he has changed from his dark past or even if we had gotten to know and appreciate their friendship so that we would've wondered what this reveal means for their friendship. Instead we don't know any of those and therefore that so-called shocking reveal is merely like a fact made known to us. Shang-Chi spends most of the movie dealing with random things that he's either thrown into or pulled into. Everything he does in regards to even the storylines that involve his family are as if everything is just a list of facts thrown in. We don't get to know what he's like deep down. What he alone feels for his friend, his sister, his mother or his father. We don't know what he's thinking or if he's feeling something and is trying to suppress his emotions with he's training. He just says that they did this and that to him or his sister. That his mother was nice and his father like this and that again as if he's just explaining backstory. If Instead they had him explain it rather emotionally vulnerable to his friend in a time of loneliness and not fully as how things were (his point of view and not exactly what happened) it would've evolved his character, him and ms. Comic relief's friendship and maybe even his sister's and his father's characters if they got to reveal their perspectives. The sister is truly meh because you could just straight up edit her out and maybe keep her for the sequels and all you'd miss would be some boring shallow women-can-also-fight messages that btw are so primitive that it's actually mildly insulting that the creators felt like their audience actually needed such messages. There are some good ideas behind the father's arc that got me a little interested at first but again, we don't really get to be in his shoes and really feel what his powers and centuries of knowledge and lust for power do to a person and what having a wife that changes such a man for the better can look like. We're just introduced to all of it as if it's just a list of facts that needs checking out. Ms. Comic relief aka Awkwafina embodies a certain percentage of what is wrong with this movie. She's an annoying good for nothing comic relief who moves along with anything just because the movie says she's Shang's friend and also because the creators knew that adding a comic relief would bring some more money. Oh and did I say good for nothing? Well fear not because also as a boring cliché the useless comic relief must all of a sudden out of the freaking blue become useful. She just freaking learns how to be Legolas with some training and takes down a full blown threat to humanity with a one of a kind trick shot.Another big flaw of the movie is it's sometimes unnecessary over the top moments. The bus fight should've just been a cool fight in the bus but then turned into this huge mess but it was still okay. What dropped the ball in this case was the huge soal-sucking creatures that were all of a sudden shoved into the movie and were immediately represented as a threat to the world or the universe or something. This didn't work well because of 2 reasons that are very connected to each other.One is that in the MCU we've come to see so many Avengers level threats that having another and expecting it to be good must be done in a newer and more creative way. Just putting a big monster is very unimaginative.The second and more complete reason is that just like No Time To Die the movie spends most of its time reveling in what seems like a personal territory for the protagonist and then all of a sudden the threat is worldwide. Both No Time To Die and Shang-Chi would've benefited from a more personal and grounded environment. Bond is in the end a British agent and Shang-Chi is a warrior with a dark family past that keeps coming back to him and having him take down a cult led and created by his own father which still seems like a huge feat and there's no real need to amp it up by adding magical dragons and monsters. At least if like The Suicide Squad 2021 they built up the huge worldwide threats from the beginning the audience would've had more time to have a grasp on how grave the situation would be had the protagonists not stopped it.In summery this movie isn't bad and can be at times entertaining and funny but it definitely disappoints it's premise. Oh and they also did a good job handling the relations with Iron Man 3 without taking anything back and Ben Kingsley was truly superb.",9 December 2021
darraghmoore, Expected so much more,Part of the problem was Undoubtedly I expected too much of it after seeing the trailers. The storyline is largely all over the place and not very interesting. The biggest problem I have with the movie is it's formulaic ....I've seen it all before. Marvel is better than that but unfortunately in their last two movies the story just wasn't strong enough.If I'm honest when it came to the end fight I just didn't care anymore and was bored by it.I personally didnt find the movie funny either.,9 September 2021
Aris25," Honestly, better than I expected!","When Marvel first announced its Phase 4, I admit that I wasn't exactly excited about Shang-Chi. I had never even heard of the hero, so I was a lot more hyped for Spiderman and Doctor Strange than a complete unknown.Watching the movie, I was pleasantly surprised. Simu Liu is very likable as the main character, while Tony Leung is a big name in China and he demonstrates why. The man is a criminal who trained his own child as an assassin, yet through his acting you still feel sympathy for him when he broods over his lost love.The fighting scenes are also exceptionally well done and visually the movie is stunning, trying to incorporate some oriental elements into the MCU.Sure there are some woke snippets here and there, they sadly seem mandatory for any movie these days. Things like Katy mastering archery in a couple of days or Shang-Chi's sister teaching herself combat because their father wouldn't train a girl and despite that, somehow being on the main character's level. But you can overlook these with a little effort.If there is one thing I did not enjoy, it's the scenes with the dragon. I feel that it bogged down the movie with an unnecessary cgi-fest. For me, it would have served the movie a lot better if the story focused on pure combat and the 10 rings themselves. I would have also liked to see Shang-Chi struggle more with his upbringing. It would have made his character a lot more interesting and nuanced than presenting a child assassin as a well adjusted typical American.Despite the above points which in my eyes are missed opportunities, the movie was definitely better than I expected and the mere fact that I look forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi, makes me count this as a win for Marvel.",11 September 2021

amieglass, Like watching a cartoon for little kids,"Was hopeful the story with a predominantly Asian cast would have succeeded as well as Black Panther did in the Marvel realm for a non-white-dominated cast, but this was such a disappointment. And what a lost opportunity! The cast was literally the only redeeming thing about the movie. Otherwise the script and CG effects were so bad that I just lost interest in the movie and stopped paying attention. It seemed like probably 95% of the movie was filmed in front of a green screen and someone did some really fast cheap animations to fill in the rest. After watching a movie like Dune (2021), where you never once get distracted by poor special effects, I know what is possible and I just can't escape into a cartoon world anymore. Even the costumes were cheap. Like they could only afford two rolls of fabric and were supposed to believe that everyone coordinated their outfits and wore brand new clothes all on the same day? And Awkwafina's character was pointless throughout the entire movie, so they gave her a purpose at the very end that made no sense at all for her character. The interest in quality was not priority for this movie at all, and really strays from the Marvel films' reputation unfortunately. Such a bummer.",1 December 2021

bannerninja, Fine martial arts/fantasy movie - it just has very little to do with Shang-Chi comics,"I realize that there are some problematic elements in the original Shang-Chi Master of Kung-Fu comics and I was not expecting a 1:1 between comics and movie, but this has nothing in common with the comics except the name of main character.Its a fine martial arts movie and good fun for most of the family as its the usual soft-violence from Marvel where people might die, but it happens very cleanly.I assume there is both cultural and copyright issues with using Dr Fu Manchu at the main villain, but he was always the most interesting part of that universe - a villain utterly devoid of pity and wielding virtually unknown science that seemed a mix of black magic, alchemy and traditional science. He could easily have been updated instead of turning him into a bland martial arts powered warlord.All in all - this movie fails spectacularly in leveraging the entire gallery of interesting characters and stories from the comic books and I must say I was very disappointed at the cookie-cutter martial arts adventure I got served up.",15 November 2021

raiqem, Too much hype..,"I have no idea how this movie got to be so hyped, but because of that I for one definitely went in with high expectations, which I normally don't fall for, but I've really not seen anything negative about it, so I thought, ok, this must really be that good I guess.Aaaand, no..
Other than the fighting choreography, which is probably one of the best in the Marvel movies released thus far, everything else falls flat on its face.By far the biggest problem is the casting, not one character in this movie stands out, and it never feels like they ""fit in"", which is something that Marvel has excelled at with their former movies, par Captain Marvel of course, but this is why it's important to have charismatic actors and proper casting.Both ""Katy"" and ""Xialing"" stuck out like a sore thumb, the acting was atrocious and the forced ""comedy"" scenes made me cringe in my seat at times.Honestly, not since Captain Marvel have I seen such god awful casting, and there's definitely magnitudes better actors out there, but they went with this for some reason....You are also made to believe that ""Shang-chi"" and ""Katie"" are together, but I've never seen such little charisma between two characters in a movie before.Main character, not quite as bad, but it really didn't feel like he fit into the role, I could see him being fine for another studio, but again, it's Marvel and you have certain expectations from them.I won't go much into the story and writing, cause it was mediocre and forgettable, with a lot of cliches and ""jokes"" that didn't land at all.Honestly, this felt like a bootleg version of a Marvel movie. Just incredibly overhyped when this doesn't go above a 6 on a good day, and while I typed that I suddenly realized why it got so hyped...rather obvious really, but I'm not from the US, so it just dawned on me now.Oh well, either way, if you're bored and got nothing to do, it's ok, just don't expect the usual Marvel quality.",11 November 2021
mackcrocker, My thoughts,My thoughts on Shang-Chi are that this was a really good movie and it is actually one of the better Marvel movies. I really enjoyed this movie. The fight choreography was really great and it almost reminded me of crouching tiger in some scenes. It also gave me some Jackie Chan movie vibes in some parts like the way Shang chi fought. It really connected to the marvel universe really well I thought and it also expands it as well. The acting was top notch all around. I thought I was going to hate awkwafina but she actually did a great job she was really funny and she could get emotional in some scenes. A lot of the comedy landed but there was some minor jokes that weren't funny but I got passed those and the other jokes made up for it.the Mandarin was a really intimidating figure. I really thought he could destroy anyone. The big fight scene at the end was really awesome and it's a huge spectacle that had me on the edge of my seat. I loved how they implemented the Asian culture into the films plot. It also ties in some threads from pass movies that really made me glad to finally have answers for. The cgi was amazing and it was very awe inspiring to watch. This was way better than the last marvel movie and I really want to see more of Shang-chi in the future. I give Shang-chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings a 9/10.,3 September 2021
patrickdtanswell, One of the better Marvel offerings,"Shang-Chi has a great tone, engaging characters, mostly solid action and a good script. This movie is at its best when it sets itself apart from other marvel films, and at its worst when it adheres to the formula. Shang Chi himself wavers between being an engaging, relatable protagonist and a boring run of the mill hero type. One thing this film excels at is storytelling through action. Some of the intimate kung fu scenes are giving us a lot of information, story and emotion. Most writers will emphasise the phrase ""Show, don't tell"", and this film often does just that to its credit. Katy is sometimes a funny and relatable character and sometimes annoying. The gags are kinda good in this movie too.For me, the highlight of the film is most certainly Shang Chi's father. He's human, he's charismatic, he's powerful, he's kind, loving, harsh and violent.I think the latter parts of the film get a little dull and by the numbers, as if they took all the things that worked about Black Panther and just transplanted them to an asian theme.Overall very different from the other MCU films, not without issues but fairly enjoyable.",4 February 2022
maayanconsta, Very Recommend to watch shang-chi and the Legend of the ten rings,"Great movie and one of the best superheroes in the mcu, very recommend to watch:)",7 September 2021
reggieamadeo, Very mid,"To be completely honest, the movie is good and enjoyable. The special effects were great, the fight scene between wenwu and li was a nice homage to older kungfu movies. The magical land of Ta Lo is a nice dimension for the MCU to tackle, a more family-friendly fantasy at which Disney has mastered. The story itself wasn't too hard to swallow and in my opinion, Tony Leung stole the show.To the bad parts:
I feel as though most of the movie is an exposition dump, the story just has way too much aspects and the movie is barely capable to explain them. Whether it be about the secret map to Ta Lo, the Great Protector or just Shang Chi's mom. I also think acting and casting is a bit lacking.Simu's character is lovable and all but does not evoke strong emotions. Awkwafina's character is just wacky and 9/10 times we can see her surprised with her mouth open, not to mention her being more than able to use a bow within idk? Less than a week? Zhang Meng'Er was great and fresh! I think she did really well in this film. Tony Leung was a great pick, no arguments on that. Michelle Yeoh is good sure but I feel like I always see her in roles like this (safe but not fresh).All in all, I do respect the asian representation (I'm asian myself) but the movie does not empower. I hope Hollywood would bring on more and more asian actors/actresses.",9 January 2022

mohdarificc, Excellent moive,"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.",22 September 2021

giedriusles, it is never too late to add anything new..,"Awaited and received, the first Asian superhero to cover at least some of the comic book covers.the film is more suitable for phase 2 or phase 3 but not as delayed as Black Widow.actor Simu Liu has a lot of charisma and I hope his changes and seriousness will be more visible in the future, because physical preparation looks strong.brightly marked trio - Tony Leung Chiu-wai, Fala Chen, Meng'er Zhang reflects the best balance between the characters but ... Awkwafina looks completely cheap and more promotional than a serious character.the film looks fantastic and startling visually, the story is somewhat simplified but I hope it will be deepened in the future, so the time is really short and you can enjoy the film in full, so I can strongly recommend Marvel to the fans of the film. I saw 2 dragons in most of the movie posters, I thought only because of the commercials but they look stunning and have a much deeper start to this film than the supporting characters, here only a small detail.the film itself is a lot of action, with a variety of fighting scenes, so you can feel a big difference from the whole Marvel movie .",11 November 2021
Belldogg81, Short-Changed and the Lacking of Many Things,"If the first three entries of phase four are anything to go by, Endgame was more prophetic than it was meant to be.Along with the ok Black Widow, the messy and boring Eternals, Shang-Chi serves as another middling entry into the MCU.Whilst the cast are by and large fine and some of the action is fine, at no point does this film do anything we haven't seen before. More than once.The film also suffers from no genuine feeling of jeopardy which isn't unusual in the MCU but when a new character is in the middle of such heavily choreographed scenes which follow typical MCU action scene beats, it's hard to care what happens.The fantasy element towards the end changes the tone slightly but it is really bland and cheesy. Sickly Sweet Disney script writers seem to have their fingerprints all over it. Again this reliance on a giant CGI fest of a last act peppered with cannon fodder monsters and slow-mo shots between the main characters as they are ""in danger"" was played out a long time ago.It seems as though many have enjoyed it though.

Why is Wong training the Abomination? Who cares it's funny even if it makes no sense. Random creature in cell can find the way to the magical land? Very lazy writing. Why did the Father think he could take over a land of warriors and magical creatures when just one of them kicked his butt? Who knows.

Wingzzz, Noice,I'll keep it short & sweet. This way exceeded my expectations.

Post credit scenes are hinting at some big stuff make sure to stick around!,11 September 2021
infinitetyler, Easily Clears Disney's Own Low Bar,"The fight choreography, stunts & SFX teams definitely carry this movie, they all did a fantastic job. Story-wise, I wish they would have either committed to making SC a new IP (is that illegal to do now?) or stuck to the original story butchered in Iron Man about The Mandarin & 10 rings rings of power. He had a giant freakin Godzilla lizard named Fing Fang Foom, and that was awesome(sometimes it's the simple things in life that are meaningful).The movie gets off the ground pretty quickly and stays pretty engaging up until about the 1:15 mark, then takes a bit of a dive going over backstory. It eventually picks back up again with some battle scenes, and then does absolutely everything in its power to ruin your previous 2 hours with the final 5 minutes & mid/post-credits scenes. They just couldn't let it go out on a not-stupid note.The acting was pretty limited. Director: ""Everyone just act kinda stoic, maybe stare into the middle-distance a bit- great! Except you Awkwardfina, you say everything that crosses you mind. There's nothing you can say that isn't hilarious!"" Awk is like the Jar-Jar Binks of this movie. Like maybe she heard ""outlandish sidekick"", saw ""Rush Hour"" and thought, ""So do my best Chris Tucker... Got it!"". Ronnie acts like himself.All in all, a pretty enjoyable & forgettable film. As far as Marvel/Disney+ goes, this is arguably the best thing they've put out since End Game. Definitely better than Black Widow, Wandavision, Falcon, Hawkeye, What If... The politics behind this movie are pretty hilarious, so maybe look up the behind the scenes drama during the slow part in the middle.",1 January 2022

konstantinveniaminov, review,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.",25 January 2022
drravi-50331, A perfect marvel movie?,"I was pleasantly surprised by the movie's good mix of emotions, action scenes, and light humour.The main characters had quite a depth to them. Shang Chi himself, having strayed so much from his family at the very start of the movie, had deep reasons for doing so. A similar depth is seen for the other main characters.Good and bad is not so clear cut. It's impressive to see a mild version of that confusion displayed in this movie. Just enough to titillate the viewer.",29 January 2022

gxyan, Very nice fight scene,This movie was very engaging to me. The fight scenes were very impressive.

indronilpaul, Not That great,Very Predictable movie. Not that great as the review and ratings shows.,8 September 2021
justbasicjoseph, Ehhhh,"The beginning starts off with a beautiful dance fight scene between the antagonist and the protagonist's mother. The fighting choreography on the train scene was brilliant and alluring to watch. I even managed to chuckle when one of the passengers started to twitch stream the fight. Easily the best fight in the movie. The movie starts to become stupid to watch once the main protagonists and his friend reaches his sister's battle arena. The plot plummets once they start preparing you with meaningless lore to the fantasy world and weak characters that feel like characters from a Pokémon RPG. The final fight was weak. The characters, the land, everything was super colorful that it really felt like I was watching ""Rava: the last dragon"". It's supposed to be a battle or civil war between family. People are supposed to die, but nope there's no tension here because why would there be, look at the color on that dragon and the characters weapons, why would I think that. We are constantly reminded that it's a Disney film.The story was somewhat interesting to see through the backstory of the father, son, and daughter. It would've been more interesting if they attempted to show the main protagonists try to do his fathers wishes to assassinate his target and decides at the last minute not to do it. As well the story could've focused more on the father and the son like a duality. Maybe like how the father came into power again rebuilding his yakuza army. Maybe like the same way the 1st Spider-Man movie did with Osborn and Peter.This movie was disappointing. Better than Eternals though and it is worth to watch but only a 1/3 of the way through. Do not buy this movie or watch on your own. Good family movie.",14 February 2022
kikogod," Very good, but too overhyped also!","Overall, I really liked the film, but I don't think it's what the reviews are making it to be. Definitely one of the most over-praised ever, in my opinion.Let's start with the things I liked, and this is definitely the beginning, the first act. Mandarin's brutal battle with the armies hints at the epic and great effects that await us and the power of the rings. Also, the director manages to introduce us to the main characters - Shang Chi and Katie and the great chemistry between them, with very few and correctly shot scenes. The two radiate a very pleasant warmth and you really feel their friendship. We also witness two of the best-made battle scenes I've seen in a movie, the one on the Bus and on the scaffolding around the skyscraper. Maybe that's where the problem is rooted and the film gets a little underwhelming over time, because these scenes were so good that nothing could reach them afterwards, especially the CG fest, which turned out to be the finale.Another plus I can point out, as a consequence of the above is the directing itself, the cinematography and the music. The film looks and is shot beautifully, colorful when needed, without overdoing it, the same with the gloomy scenes (which makes me angry that I had to wear the damn 3D glasses again). Scenes inspired by old Chinese classics such as ""Hero"", ""House of the Flying Daggers"" and ""Tiger and Dragon"" were great, poetic and with enough respect for these old classics! The battle scenes were also an absolute peak and as I said - the scaffolding scene can be a master class on how to shoot one. The music also contributed very nicely with the light chill beats, perfectly complementing the urban scenes and the epic Asian notes included in the fairytale segments. Some of the acting surprised me a little - most were good, especially Tony Leung as the father. And, would you believe it - Aquafina or whatever that name is. I didn't expect her to surprise me so pleasantly at all, but I liked her even more than the main guy Simu, who was honestly wooden at times, despite his charisma. Congratulations to the actress who played Shong Chi's mother, she was wonderful. I will also mention the relatively funny cameo from a rather controversial character that we remember from Iron Man 3 :)And in this line of thought - to say the things that did not work for me. Namely, the fairy-tale / fantasy part, as well as the seriously slugish second act, where I think they went too far with the flashbacks, the exposition and the dramatization. I don't know, maybe the problem is in me, but as things started to move into the dimension of fairy tales and fantasy, somehow that took me out of the movie. It came to me too abruptly and unexpectedly to be SO made up. Especially after the super well done scenes happening on Earth. Also, when the whole mystery began to unfold, there were too long scenes with silence, dramatic looks, explanations, exposure, flashbacks, that started to lose me a little and roll my eyes.The final act, unfortunately, is a typical Marvel / superhero epic with a bit too much monsters, creatures and fiction that I could handle. I understand that the film is a cultural phenomenon, especially for China, and they wanted to weave culture, mythology, legends into one, but even though we have witnessed all sorts of cosmic and fantastic wonders in this universe - something about these dragons and wonders took me out slightly from the movie. I would accept them much better in animated / comic form.However, the very way it ends, where things became more grounded again and even the characters explained with self-irony and joked about what happened, was great and definitely raised my rating slightly. Also the fantastic mid-credit scene.After all that has been said, it is very difficult for me to find a correct assessment of the film. On the one hand, seven is not enough for me, eight is too much for me, so I nail it to * 7.5 / 10 *",14 September 2021

Iamysh, Wow what a movie...,"Form the moment I sat into theatre I was lost in shang chi's worlds. Movie doesn't rely heavily on jokes which is a big relief cause marvel movies nowadays rely too much on jokes they stuff joked in emotional scenes too. Like they played Thor's depression for jokes, Thor meeting his dead mother after a long time was also foreshadowed by jokes. Jokes occupy most of newer marvel movies even endgame falls victim to this. But this movie is different there are joked but they are placed well. Characters won't joke between fights or between emotional heavy hitting scenes and boy the action in this movie its captivating to say the least. The dynamic between Shang chi and his father is awesome. You sympathize with both Shang chi and his father. Marvel feels like old school marvel this time. Its his origin story not many character pop from other flicks and even when they do they don't take much spotlight. Definitely watching it another time.....",13 September 2021

jsdmnd, Marvel Movie?,A Marvel movie that morphed into a Disney movie with Shang Chi as the princess in peril and in need of soul searching and having found redemption at the end.Sounds familiar?The only missing ingredients to make it a fully blown Disney movie are the song and dance sequences.Marvel Studios kept on butchering their own properties which is inexcusable. They should of stuck to the original premise of The Hands of Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu comic book series instead of a Mulan type with a male lead.What a missed opportunity. This could been turned into a Raid Redemption type movie which would have been more appropriate for the character.,12 November 2021

radinsri, It's time to break away from the prejudices,"Finally I'm penning down my thoughts about this movie. The anticipation took hold of me knowing that Tony Leung is finally getting his Hollywood break... That gave me euphoria. Imagine this was the first movie that I've watched in the cinema after the outbreak... Imagine the excitement, right?But heads up to self, never enter a cinema hall with skyrocketed expectations or else you'll get hit by devastation. Oh dear. What went wrong? How I'd wish the film strayed away from those typecast and stereotypical characterisations of the Asian community. We don't need to be fed with such storyline. I was hoping Destin would go deeper on a more profound route of cultural reality and beliefs, not the whole 'You need to ace in life with a great job, not working aimlessly as a parking valet'. Then we have an extremely dubious role in Katy. There was no clear indication of her personality other than being his sidekick with no power or ability and of course, a jester to the narrative. I would either buff her role up or omit her out completely by replacing Katy with a worthy character like Xialing in terms of character prominence. She should have been the chosen one to cross over with Shang Chi at the end, not Katy. And I was left baffled by that. A worthy mate for drama and action, no? The saving grace of the film was the wealth of experience and weight carried by Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Ben Kingsley. They tried to strengthen what can be seen as a potential yet flawed narrative. Yet their brilliance was cornered by the weaker leads.My verdict? Any sequel without Tony Leung? Count me out...",17 January 2022

moorieman-563-542317, The worst Marvel movie!!!,"The good
Trevor returns!The first Asian American Fantasy/Martial Arts movie (?!)Some decent looking CG creatures and FXThe usual Marvel references to other moviesThe post credit sceneThe bad
The script puts a lot of emphasis on the variety of locations as the adventure unfolds, unfortunately somehow forgets its characters need to show some believable ""emotions"" too. So, basically because of this, there - firstly - is no real depth in character development and - secondly - as a consequence NO chemistry between ANY of the characters at allThe story is extremely foreseeable and doesn't have any surprises which wouldn't be a problem, if the story is at least presented in a manner that ACTUALLY was exciting and engagingA completely underused Tony Leung who doesn't even need to act at allMost of the fighting choreography felt a bit amateur-ishSome Asian clichés are really presented as clichés (Karaoke, not understanding the 4 sounds in mandarin, underground fight club)The hiphop music parts were actually more annoying than fittingSome of the language spoken mixes US english with some mandarin words, but they are somehow never translated (Qingming Jié!?) So, what's the audience of this film? Chinese American teenagers? American teenagers? Everyone?!The humor is often very flat and one dimensionalThere will be a sequel...For people who want a brainless family film with the usual ""hero needs to suffer to be strong"" storyline, give it a try. For anyone who wants a much more fun Chinese Wu Xia/Fantasy series, go watch ""Douluo Continent"" (Not the Animation). A low budget Drama, but it's comparably funny, well presented and the characters are actually likable. Plus good FX and an interesting and complex ""magic"" system!Sorry, Shang-Chi.

Sjr-lane, Middle-of-the-pack MCU film.,"There's a lot to love about Shang-Chi. There's also a lot to grimace about. Both feelings lurk beneath the surface and draw awareness to themselves at various times, creating a wishy-washy overall impact.Where I'm critical? There's a bit of a haphazard pace to this film. Many scenes contain plot points and/or action sequences that are unbalanced in terms of what is glossed over and what is overly drawn out. There were serious opportunities to do some world building with the new ingredients provided by the vigorously refreshing Asian cultural influence, but it felt like director Destin Daniel Cretton was often going through the motions, checking boxes like he was playing Marvel bingo. The climax, while visually appealing, was predictable from moment to moment and really did not have me on the edge of my seat. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's villain also didn't quite stick the landing with me, though I've read that his character has really resonated with Asian audience members so I'll humbly accept that maybe his motives lay just a bit outside of my perspective. There were also several ""oh, okay, sure"" moments, lets call them, but a least the writers had the modesty to poke fun at themselves (see: Katy's awe at her own random overnight mastery of a certain skill later in the film).What I really enjoyed? The cast and characters, first of all. Marvel almost always gets this right. Awkwafina's charisma is palpable. Her character, Katy, never gets in the way of Shang-Chi's natural progression and is genuinely interesting in her own right. I also appreciate the writers' restraint in not simply using her as something to be exploited by the villains to distract/misdirect Shang-Chi. Meng'er Zhang is also a revelation as Xialing, Shang-Chi's scorned, steely sister. Although, a bit more clarity on what her characters' ultimate goals are would have gone a long way as her post-credits appearance left me a bit confused as to where she stands in the greater story. In regards to Simu Liu, I personally felt like he got a bit hoodwinked by the writers who really didn't give Shang-Chi a strong personality other than kicking butt. Regardless, I totally praise his performance and find him endearing to no end. I have faith that he'll really shine when he's plopped into the dynamic of the Avengers. As an aside, just wanted to give an obligatory shoutout to the visual effects and concept designs of the mythical creatures and surreal locations in the film. They really nailed it.To that end, a completely worthy addition to the MCU that sometimes feels like it's only purpose was to introduce us to the new toy in the Marvel universe that is ""the ten rings"" themselves.",3 September 2021
carltonk6, Don't really understand the hype to be honest,"Don't get me wrong, from a visual and colourfully fantastical point of view, this film was amazing.But for an MCU film, which we have all come to love for being so intricate and detailed, this film falls flat for me. It just doesn't make any sense with the universe that the MCU has built up to this point.Certain rules and historic lore has been completely discarded. And I think the villain of this movie is one of the worst and least relatable of the entire franchise. It just made no sense. And even during the climactic ""battle"" things were happening that just weren't explained. We just kind of had to accept what we were seeing as possible without understanding what was happening.And unfortunately the character depth of most of the cast in this film was very poor. Certain characters were sort of just there for the sake of it. With no real purpose or direction, and they were some of the closest characters to the main guy!I don't often say this - infanct I've only said it once before when leaving the cinema after a marvel film, I feel disappointed, confused and left thinking ""they could've done it better""",28 September 2021
jcasterline-11406, Not terrible.,"Fair origin film. Generally, Marvel's character introduction films are slightly above average affairs. They need to introduce a character that some people may not be familiar with. This usually leads to a lengthy stretch of the beginnings of those movies to be slow. This movie, however, felt like it kicked off fairly quickly and maintained a decent pace. After the ramp up to Infinity War and Endgame, and bombastic, wild action in them, this movie feels like a step back. However, you need to keep in mind that this is the beginning of a new story arc in the MCU. Build up is necessary. In that regard, this movie is a success.With that said, I do have a few gripes.Awkwafina grated on my ears and nerves for the whole movie. A personal preference. I don't remove a star for that.Many of the action sequences were well done but filmed with the cameras too close. Had they been filmed from a greater distance they would have been more impressive and flowed better overall.That's pretty much it. I found it to be one of the better origin films. Nothing spectacular, but it was VERY watchable.",24 September 2021
saimranjha-71519, really changed the mcu,This movie was amazing if you have not seen it i highly recamend you see it.,4 September 2021
njniva, Very Enjoyable Movie,"For me personally, that was a 10 out of 10 movie that I enjoyed the whole way through because I am able to ignore minor problems and I enjoy martial arts and stuff like that a lot in movies. This movie did however have some minor plot holes and confusing aspects which is why for most people it is not a 10 out of 10 and this is why I gave it a 9 out of 10.",7 September 2021
jesselmartinez-69391, Too overhyped,"The CGI was great but apart from it everything is just ok at the best, It didn't connect with any character at all. To be honest wait for the film to come on streaming services, not worth it to go to the cinema. The storyline was kind of confusing.",8 September 2021
Olian04, Best marvel movie for a long time. Too bad it had to fit into the MCU,"This is a really good movie. The only bad parts are the parts that tie it into the MCU. I like the MCU, but it kinda feels really forced with this movie.",14 November 2021
cvcxtvdq, Good movie but too woke,"It starts really good. The main characters is good casted. Slow moments aside, the story was not too predictable. And now, the WOKE part: Ben Kikgley's role was misfitted, really not necassary to fil it in like this.",19 November 2021
jubayermahmud-17295, Full of AWESOMENESS,"Shan-Chi gives a totally different vibe from other mcu movies which has touched me so deeply. It was really very important for phase 4 and shang chi did a really great job!!! I loved this movie...so I gave it 10/10. It has both action and emotion to catch the audience. It surely won't disappoint anyone whether he/she is a marvel fan or not
This was worth of watching.",4 September 2021
siameserich, Impressive but one bit that bother my feeling.,This film brought good feeling about family and the impression of MCU. I like VFX in the films. Looks amazing.But one thing that bother me is the film shows how much Shang-Chi's Dad loves him but why his dad hit him to the bottom of the lake and left him died there? His dad did not trying to pull him up or sort of at all. Is this how his dad loves him?,11 November 2021
ericschi, Excellent movie to pick up MCU p4,"From start to finish this movie delivers. The acting is great, the writing is Marvel (you like it or you don't, I do), the action is brilliant, scenery, story, CGI: top notch.If this is what P4 has in store for us, yes please!",9 November 2021
rasbivaa9, I had fun with it.,"I would give 9/10 for it if they were fully speaking Chinese .

rvgillam-44732, Beautiful movie!!,Great story!! Great acting!! Great fight choreography!! Marvel movie done right!! Baffled that i waited so long to see this. I honestly had low expectations going in and I was extremely surprised because this movie greatly surpassed them. Looking forward to what's next in the Shang Chi chapter.,13 November 2021

hareshvaru, Good to see marval again in the theater 🎥 👍,Awesome movie. Good to see it marvel movie in theater.,3 September 2021
rzpieniak, Formulaic but fresh,"As others have mentioned the fight choreography is probably the best to date in the MCU. Long panning shots like The Raid, John Wick, Daredevil (Netflix series), where it's almost like the punches actually land, and the use of the environment is almost comical in how ridiculous these fights become. The score reminded me of Black Panther where they incorporate some pretty awesome hip hop tracks, whereas in Black Panther some of the score felt forced and out of place, this films bass drops and transition to versus added a pretty slick feel to the film. Unlike other most MCU entries post Avengers, this film didn't seem to focus on the grand plans ahead in the MCU which is okay, I personally expected a little more. I also felt like the motivations of the villain were unclear for a large portion of the film, it was hard to feel connected to any particular cause. Some of the dialogue was stilted, jokes landed less often than usual and there were a couple moments that took you out of the film. Overall, it's a fun film with unique qualities that any fan of the genre should enjoy.",11 September 2021
krishorvat-06642, One of better Marvel movies.,"I enjoyed watching it , didnt expect that but i really liked it , and the fighting scenes were awesome . Great movie , lots of martial arts which i love so Im giving 10/10.",14 November 2021
EyeSeeMovies," Good start, can't finish strong","First hour had good unique action scenes, paired with typical Marvel style comic jokes, but fails to deliver a strong finish. It failed to establish a true villain and a motive behind their actions. It took time to tell a back story but struggled with pacing and didn't fully develop the character to be cared for. In the end, I didn't care for the hero if he lived or died. When the credits rolled, didn't care if there's going to a sequel. Shang-Chi unfortunately will work best as a a cameo in upcoming super hero movies. The movie failed to really separate from other super heroes in the universe.",12 November 2021

This movie made it onto my top 3 favorite MCU movies list.The new unique MCU origin story of Shang-Chi wasn't that original but it was still very fun to go through. Sometimes you forget you're watching a Marvel movie. Everything from the visuals, music and fight choreography was amazing and on point. There was also a good amount of humor inside but also a good amount of touching moments.If you can see it, you should definitely go see it.",15 September 2021

ryanhaodongchen, Bland and disappointing,"I went into the theater expecting something pretty good from this movie. When it ended all I could think of was ""That's it?""While the visuals are spectacular, the story and acting seem to take a backseat. The two villians of the story don't seem compelling and the main character doesn't really feel special.Overall, pretty lacking movie.",3 October 2021
civanirencin, A missed opportunity,"It had the potential to be one of the best Marvel movies I've seen with its music, great action sequences and cinematography, but they wasted it. There are so many silly jokes and no scene made me laugh except for the ones in Fake Mandarin. Let's come to the character of Kathy... The acting of the woman is bad, the character is unnecessary. If it wasn't in the movie, nothing would have changed. It is also absurd that someone who has probably never seen an arrow in her life can become an arrow master in one day. The scene where Shang Chi's parents fought was not a fight but a dance, it was really bad. That's it. Movie isn't a bad movie but it could better.",26 September 2021
jkhorne30, Unrealistic,I have hard time with the story line since the rings belong to the Mandarin and also like Iron Man 3 I hate that they made the Mandarin into such a joke when he was a powerful and important villain to the Marvel universe.,28 December 2021
manc_tony, Interesting Concept,"An enjoyable film, showing Shang Chi's family history from his fathers side.I found it laughable when his sister, excluded from Kung-Fu training with the men of the Ten Rings, said she watched from afar and trained herself and became better than the men of the Ten Rings.More of that Yay girl power non-sense.",11 September 2021
kenaigonzalez, So refreshing to see a new hero in the MCU,"Shang-Chi was a joy from start to finish. Simu Liu and Awkwafina balance the comedy and drama of the script masterfully. The movie felt grounded, which is refreshing in comparison to the spectacle of other movies released by Marvel Studios.The choreography is top notch! This film has some of the best hand-to-hand combat sequences that I've seen in years and the cinematography only compliments that.The real heart of this movie comes from Tony Leung Chiu-wai. He stole the scene whenever he was on camera and had me deciding in my head if his character was evil or not, which is a quality that only enhances the ""villain"" role in any comic book movie.Lastly, the soundtrack by 88rising was beautifully curated and I hope will pave the way for more diverse album soundtracks.",1 October 2021
fionncopeland, Not much but enough.,"I'm no MARVEL fan but this film didn't meet my (very poor) expectations I thought that it was boring through out with fight scenes of pure cgi helping me get through it. The end fight scene was standard meeting for MARVEL but everything else was disappointing, again MARVEL never produces phenomenal films but with this the acting and comedy (more so the comedy) was so boring and mundane nothing got a giggle out of me apart from my friend making fun of the film it's self. With this I believe that Shang Chi could have been better, fight scenes were Ok and nothing impressive just ""Theme Park Cinema""",23 November 2021

A Fun Film to watch! Solid story, defined/empathetic characters, sharp script laced with wit & humor throughout, thrilling action sequences, set pieces & special effects imagery. And Michelle Yeoh (in her 2nd MCU role) is impeccable as always, fight scenes choreographed & executed w/ precision reminiscent of Crouching/Dragon. The entire cast is perfect in fact. Fast paced & easily re-watchable Film addition in the MCU.",15 November 2021
pravaa-81535, Too exaggerated,"The fight scenes would be better if they were more grounded in reality, instead of the dragon thing. You have a character who's been introduced for the first time, and you shouldn't add bunch of other elements to it.7*s for Andy Le <3.",19 September 2021
LunaticToats," Just as I suspected, it was a let down.","From the trailer, I initially thought it was gonna be nothing special or interesting. I was definitely proven right. All the hype on Twitter was what convinced me to watch it but I should probably stay away from Twitter. CGI was alright but the characters were a let down. I mean it started off fine but I almost fell asleep halfway through the film. Though, I have a slight feeling though that some people who rated this 10 and called it the best marvel movie ever haven't seen it.. anyways, this was a 3 and I'm being generous.",4 September 2021
saralueken, Solid Marvel Movie. What about the sister?????,"Watched this today and really enjoyed it! Recommend seeing it. Without saying too much, as a woman and mom, the real hero was the sister. And even my husband in the end thought the heroism would be shared, rings n all, but nope. That was disappointing.",11 September 2021
palm_mahir, It's finally nice to see some martial arts into the mix with the MCU,"The movie tells a story about Shang-Chi facing his destiny. They have done an excellent job of telling the backstory of his family. But it's a pity that the main story felt a little to short. The film has also represent the best fight choreography in the MCU. The fight scene were beautifully shot, but sometimes they cut my tension by throwing in some jokes and puts in too much CGI and it cheapens the fight scene. The jokes, music and the CGI works well in some places but also doesn't work well in some places especially during the third act. The visual in this film were great but in some scene it looks so cartoonish with this green screen stage area and it looks bad during the third act. While the movie does a great job telling a backstory of his family the film also manage to make us understand the villain motivation. The villain in this film might probably land in my top 5 best villain in the MCU.Verdict: Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Ring might not be that great for me. Is not that bad not that great, but enjoyable. 8/10.",15 November 2021

noorrezamoh," Decent, Overhyped, Too Disney","Shang-Chi was hyped so much and I thought it'd be a great movie, something new for the MCU, but it's more or less the same sort of plot, same sort of characters, same sort of disappointing villains. Marvel are getting into this 'thing' where they make you think the villain is one thing but it ends up being something else and I'm not really a fan of that. CGI was laughable in some parts but not all that bad. Refreshing movie though, some of the best fight scenes we've seen so far in the MCU. They went with the whole family thing, we've seen it a thousands times, but they did a good job at it, was pretty emotional at parts.People who are rating it low for being 'boring' have been spoiled by Infinity War and Endgame thinking there needs to be hundreds of cameos and all the Avengers in every Marvel movie. Grow up, this is a solo movie. Simple as. Same type of people who rated Black Widow low because of that. It's not as bad as some people are saying, it's a good introduction movie for Shang-Chi's character and the post-credits also leave room for the next MCU projects to come. Could develop into something great if they do it right.",3 September 2021
FromLondon99, Overall Disappointing,"Rotten Tomatoes makes it seem like it's on same level with Spider-Man 2 or The Dark Knight, but it's not even close to same level.

kickever, Was not expecting that...,"Like the title I typed, I was not expecting that at all. With the lack of advertising and no hype except from the shangchi actor himself I was expecting a low budget film with no plot but instead I got a fine course meal with a side of surprisement. I watched with amazement at the acting skills, the fighting skills (the training and hard work), the music (was lit af, it gave me into the spiderverse vibes.), the unsuspecting plot, the comedy, the characters and CGI. All of it was amazing and I will definitely watch it again and can't wait to show it to my parents. Well done ShangChi cast and crew you've out done yourself!",14 November 2021

I understand that the movie was rushed and was planned to come out during 2020 but it still felt like a disappointment. Anyways, this isn't about black widow. This movie blew me away with great CGI and AMAZING acting. The comedy relief of Katy and Trevor was great to see because it combined with the action perfectly. The actors were great, the fighting was great and looked like a dancers life work and practice, the storyline was PERFECT and the character and wolrd building was on point.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, PLEASE WATCH!TL:DR

khaotom, Good Visual and Fighting and that's about it,"The visual is stunning and the action sequence enjoyable. Other than that, there is no other redeeming quality. Plot is meh, non American actors other than Michell Yeoh dialog is dull and seemed be going through the mills. Even AwkwardFina is really awkward. The main protaganist looks like Winnie the Pooh.

atlsk, Text I sent to my sister/mom of two Toddlers/fellow wasted art degree person I always riff with about the abuse of nostalgia since we're 1 yr apart,"I've never been the biggest fan of marvel movies, however Shang Chi is a legit bonafide classic. It's like Goonies meets Harry Potter, never ending story...meets Okja crouching tiger hidden dragon...meets princess Mononoke... meets the secret garden...meets the raid...and every akira Kurosawa film (it's a lot more in depth with legit Asian film history then that but I need films you knew) it's a legit A+, 10 out of 10, 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿 up for the whole family and for art appreciators. It's seriously the best blockbuster movie that reps the craft and uses the best medium for storytelling to the masses (film) of the last few yrs. It mixes adventure, fantasy, mysticism, non cultural appropriation2non Americanized martial arts, every aspect of classic cinematography, Oscar winning acting with up and comers, non cheesy non forced humor for all
Ages, and superb pacing and storytelling. It makes every other marvel film look like trash. It's like a Pixar x studio ghibli movie but with real life actors...it's tugs on the nostalgia heartstrings through emotional suggestion w/ a hint of that original feeling; you remember that genuine hope/amazement that's always missing with the ""in your face recycling"" of the exact same bs in every other modern blockbuster leaching off the nostalgia tit. It's really something special.",12 November 2021

pouyajamshidi, Shang-Chi,"All in all Shang-Chi is a decent and amusing superhero movie but it doesn't offer anything more than that. I have to admit that marvel and Daniel Cretton have done a good job on combining Eastern (more specifically Chinese) culture, myths and action style of filmmaking with normal Western superhero cinema. Action and fighting scenes are pleasant and innovative as we all have expected, the cast and performances are also very good and among the positive aspects of the movie.However, despite this progress, the script and characterisation are still the same old thing. The movie begins very well but after one hour it becomes just like all other marvel films. Sudden changes and developments in characters, illogical decisions, unexplained details and predictable ending makes the movie completely forgettable. For me, the CGI is still not 100% compelling and gets annoying at some places.",16 November 2021

jakebunker, Not an eyecatcher,It is a pretty standard Marvel movie with a similar formula for their films so there wasn't something that really stuck out to me this time. The story is so-so and there is WAY too much CGI. In my opinion CGI is very overrated and should only be used in correct circumstances. But CGI was all over the place and I was growing not too fond with the backgrounds and settings. The characters were pretty good though and I felt like Marvel tried with this movie so I have to give it that. It's just there is nothing too spectacular to make me come back to it when there are plenty of other Marvel greats that essentially have the same story.,10 December 2021

meatygeek, Over hyped,"Disappointing but still enjoyable in short. We were shown some pretty big cameos and things in the trailer that the movie offered little more. A whole underground fighting ring barely explored or explained. Really nice choreographed fight scenes ruined by over the top cgi explosions. At one point I thought I was watching a transformers sequel. Worse part was probably the fact they shoehorned MCU links and used too much convenient plot devices. Such as ""how do we get to this impossible to find place?"" ""easy, barely an inconvenience we'll just put them in the exact place with guy with a magic sat nav and we can use a BMW to get some ad money boi""Felt too predictable and lazy.That said, fights were enjoyable in the first half, and I saw a dragon so just above average 6/10.",12 October 2021

bigchriscox, Excellent is an understatement,"This film was outstanding! I loved the backstory of Shang-Chi, possibly one of the MCU's best yet, it was very cultural, I loved how they spoke in mandarin or whatever it's called half the time, the CGI was incredibly top notch and the cast was simply superb - Simu, Tony and Fala etc all did an awesome job, but my favourite was definitely Awkwafina!

smuggerj, Pretty average but worth a watch for MCU lore,"This films starts off better than expected but then leans on clichés and lazy story writing for the second half.The change of the rings to bracelets is not a good one and the guy that wrote the screenplay for Wonder Woman 2 should not be allowed to work in the industry again, let alone be hired for this film.The fight sequences are good - the mistakes made for the Iron Fist series were not made again.

imiea," Fresh and visually stunning, but not without flaws","Shang Chi was an enjoyable Marvel experience with a fresh perspective. But, there are some flaws.The action sequences steal the show here no doubt. The fighting styles in the film brought so much freshness to the film. Absolutely loved the soundtrack too.The fantasy ""Pokemon-like"" elements is interesting and for the most part, actually felt like it fit with the story. However, it does go a bit too far. While the CGI was good, I think it was definitely overused especially in one particular scene which I won't spoil. Simu Liu puts in a solid performance and is a likeable hero. Awkwafina is fantastic as the comedic relief and its going to be fun to see them in future films.Overall, a solid 7.5/10 and a worthy addition to the MCU.",11 November 2021

hritwikraj-88909, Awful storyline..,"I usually review those movies that I loved and enjoyed watching. This review is a warning. The lead character who was supposed to carry the storyline fades and at last end up being an idiot.The gfx and action scenes are cool, the only reason I rated it 7. This movie is way too overrated. If you watch movies like once a months give it a try you may like it. But if you watch movies regularly chances are pretty High you are going to get annoyed and exasperated at the end.Lacked chemistry, no drama, but had little humour. Storyline!!!! Please... I wonder if there is a complete script.Oh,, forgot to add ..maybe Marvel introducing this character could be the reason of being overrated I'm pretty sure maximum viewers of this movie come from the ""Dubbed"" community... Yeah they get excited too much quickly...",28 November 2021
jlawnewbie, Solid movie overall- just lacking in some parts.,"I thought that this movie was pretty good. I was very excited going into it, and it seemed like it was going to be a fun time. I was right, the fights were great, it was unique and the cg was really good (for the most part) and almost all the characters felt really well developed. However: I thought the pacing felt way too fast. It seemed like Shang chi went from good martial artists to a master of these new abilities he's never learned before. Also, the movie couldn't quite decide on the tone. Half the time it was funny, and the other half it wanted to be dark. Other than that, I thought it was a good movie and it'll be interesting to see where the MCU takes this character. Definitely worth a watch.",11 September 2021
paranoiia-26206, Everyone: China bad. Me: But movies and culture is nice...,"I will keep it simple.Is this a good Action movie? Yes, if you like classic old Asian fighting movies, its perfect. Simple story of hero that fight evil. It clishe, it have funny moments, it have some drama and it have good old evil vs bad theme.Is it good marvel movie? Not really. I think most of fans of marvel are too biased and think that China bad. Dont watch... plus it dont have much Marvel easer eggs...Is it good movie overall? Its average at best. It have lots of plotholes, lots of clishe moments that not everyone like, lots of chinese styled themes that not everyone like, CGI is not really best, Acting is not best for most of time. Music is generic as hell. And ending is... not great.",12 November 2021

4. Bmw car placement straight into the jungle

HuziTheGreat," Marvel Studios' ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" Review","Marvel Studios' ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the latest modern-day extension to the MCU? Guided to craft beautifully by Destin Daniel Cretton. Shang-Chi has a massive soulfulness that future MCU movies need to take notes on and that only Black Panther did so memorably. It occurred to me while watching this movie that it is genuinely no longer about the characters we focus on, but it is their adventure toward locating themselves, and we follow that adventure here in an amazing Superhero Oriental Fantasy blockbuster. Noticeably, the VFX, scene sets, costume designs, and the special effects themselves incredibly heightened the impact of the movie and allowed a symbolic impact on the awe-inspiring production value and, as a result, the aforementioned movie knocked out in dazzling heights on a beautiful scale because of the VFX. The movement sequences and choreography are polished and stunning. Narratively, the storyline continues incredibly, and we understand the moments of humour the MCU is so well-known for, and we are all here for it. This film divided me going to the cinema and waiting for a digital component! Because of COVID-19, however, I didn't need to have the entirety of Shang-Chi spoiled earlier on with leaks, thank goodness I went to the very first showing on the opening Thursday night, I have experienced Shang-Chi several times now and in extraordinarily different formats including 4D-X. This movie displays some of the most remarkably phenomenal combat performances in a Marvel movie I had never seen in this noticeable approach previously. The movie is formulaic and well-trodden territory for Marvel and has several exceptional visual effects layered in. Shang-Chi is such an enchanting movie to watch and even better on the biggest screen you can find, keeping safety in mind at all times! If you have seen Marvel movies consistently, you've got to know that the narrative is a predictable storyline for Marvel's superhero foundation adventures. This film is full of numerous great moments, with its battle sequences and action set pieces, which is arguably undoubtedly its major attraction. But Shang-Chi has given us some outstanding personalities and characters in a live-action film like Black Panther's did so on his solitary quest. Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the most exceptional superhero movies I've watched in years, if not in the past decade. Simu Liu and Meng'er Zhang and Tony Leung Chiu Wai get considerable distinct and exceptional choreographed action choreography that we have not witnessed since Captain America: Winter Soldier. There is not any one thing like Shang-Chi I have seen before in the MCU, this film seems fresh. Shang-Chi feeds us with the deprived traditional antique sequences of martial craftsmanship, which we appreciate a lot as an audience and applauds in an incredible modern depiction. This is one of the better, exceptional Marvel films ever. I would recommend watching this one.",22 September 2021
jsumm96, Good visuals and martial arts but fairly predictable,"So the martial arts throughout this movie are very nice to watch, and the visuals for the most part also compliment this (despite the very cgi animals) but there are a couple fairly predictable plot points and I felt that the movie tried too hard to be funny with a few eye-rolling jokes.Overall probably one of the weaker MCU films but a decent enough watch.",23 April 2022
mcadrianminecraft, VERY Great move.,"This movie does VERY well as a stand-alone movie to just take a step back from the huge marvel universe. Although what also makes it so great is the ties they make to the rest of the marvel universe so it feels like something new but also familiar. Plot was really great, and action scenes were amazing.Great feel and aesthetics overall, really up there with Dr. Strange.",2 September 2021
MrSamWilson, Poignant & Thrilling MCU Adventure,"The movie is very good in all the criteria it picks up. You'll have a great 2 hours journey with this movie.

Icymt88, Genuinely the worst CGI I've seen from Marvel,"So much of this movie looked incredibly fake. A movie like this could've been more focused on martial arts but instead it's bright flashy colors in scenes that look fake. The dialogue was corny as well but I didn't mind the story, even if it was poorly paced. I don't know if the budget was lower, but it seems to me that, as with black panther, when one of their films is built to include a new culture, the cgi has been awful, maybe because they spent less as a lack of faith? Regardless, not a great movie, 3/10.",23 November 2021
ByrdBrainReviews, An Unrelated Bland Movie,"I was hopeful for this movie, being that it had no ties to any other Marvel characters, it had potential to become something unique. I was not given what I wanted. The main character felt like robots for the plot, they almost never have any emotions. The whole movie feels like your average Marvel action movie, just a little less interesting.",24 February 2022
badlydrawnboy15, There is nothing new.. boring,This movie was an absolute waste of time. Marvel didn't do anything fresh except this superhero is of Asian origin. Still to watch a Hollywood movie without Jackie chan or Lucy liu or jet li or Michelle yeoh where Asian characters are shown. The lead guy who plays shang chi has an expression less face... did they even conduct an audition. If you miss this movie trust me you wouldn't regret. If you do you will.,17 April 2022

Compared to Marvel's other Phase 4 efforts I would put it below Black Widow and WAY above Eternals.The script was good, the acting was good, the fight scenes were... okay. The bus was the best. For Marvel's best fighter he seemed to lose a lot.I love Aquafina but I think she needs to choose more roles where she doesn't basically play the same character all the time.Biggest drawback the green screen. It looked like you were watching 3D but didn't need glasses.",15 November 2021

amazinggracebridges," Beautiful, unique film with a predictable plot","The imagery in the film is unique for Marvel and beautiful, but the plot leaves much to be desired.

fezannsattar, Great origin movie,"Great origin movie, the best one so far in the mcu, a little bit long to start, but Great origin movie, the best one so far in the mcu, a little bit long to start, but from the moment the characters arrive in Macao till the end, the movie is really entertaining. If the movie has one problem, it's that it's super predictable (common for all the mcu sadly). Apart from that, I really liked the artistic direction based on Chinese mythology, combined with the great special effects and cgi it makes some super aesthetic and cool moments. I also want to highlight the charisma of Simu Liu (Shang-Chi) and especially the charisma of Tony Leung Chiu-Wai (Shang-Chi's father) which is just incredible. For the quality of acting, it was good, great for a mcu movie, but good overall (didn't really like the acting of Katy by Nora Lum, neither the prestations of the characters from Ta Lo, they don't embodies the wisdom we expect from them).Overall the story itself is great, even if it's mayne a little bit too classic (fight for the memory of the mother against a not-so-mean bad guy that will go to the light side at the end of the confrontation for finally sacrifice himself...) but all the atmosphere, the landscapes, the choreography of the fights, the special effects, some jokes, and the epicness make this film the best Marvel origin story so far and a great Marvel movie.7/10 for the movie itself, 9/10 for what this movie is doing for the Asian community, hope more people and children will be finally able to identify themselves in a superhero, really sad that this movie is banished in China...",17 September 2021

I got excited with all the good reviews and expected a breathtaking Asian culture movie and got a formulaic boring origin story. The movie had great visuals but you could already tell how to story was going to unfold, all hero cliches with a story cliche plus boring soundtrack . I hope marvel gets their act together and start doing some good movies. At least for me a 21 year old Honduran this was as boring as my experience with black widow. I hope eternals has some new stuff to experience and I am looking forward to Spiderman no way home, saying that this was a disappointment.",18 November 2021

hfusion," Cool film, however Katy/Kate wasn't needed","Let me start off by saying I enjoyed the film A LOT. However I feel like Katy's character (I don't remember what exactly her character's name was) is almost unnecessary. I understand her whole thing is comic relief, but I personally didn't find it funny. It's almost like they're trying to appeal to one specific demographic with her character (which I understand and I'm just not the target audience). But everytime she makes a joke it's like I'm supposed to just wait for it to be done so the story can continue. If her character was completely removed from the movie, nothing would change and that's the biggest problem. She doesn't add anything. And when you have to watch a movie with a character he adds nothings but time to a movie, it gets a little annoying. Also. The arrow? There's no reason she should've been able to make that shot. I don't care if I have to ""suspend disbelief"". It makes no sense.",20 December 2021
RawDawgU, Really Marvel??? Dont waste your time!,"Probably one of the worst Marvel Movies of all time. Even for fantasy this is ridiculous, the CG was decent but thats about it.

Shang Chi had never used the rings before, and he, after almost dying, while fighting his father and trying to save the world, in intense pressure, controlled the rings even better than his father who had been practically practicing for hundreds of years! This makes no sense. This is probably the most incoherent thing marvel has ever done in an MCU movie.I think marvel also missed the opportunity to tie this with eternals. They could show that the monsters are actually deviants, Shang Chi couldn't stop them, and then eternals came to stop them. That would've been great.",14 November 2021

There is no bad person in this movie, so there's not enough conflict. At the end, they have to come up with a dragon out of nowhere to be the big boss which doesn't quite make sense. By the way, Liang Chaowei is really fashionable and young looking in this movie, great for people in his 60s. Liu Simu delivered a good performance.",11 September 2021

Angell_AG, One of Marvel's best origin story.,"Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and combats well with the fight choreography, which is the strongest part about the movie. As Marvel's first Asian led superhero movie, it amazingly depicts the story of a young man trying to become someone who is completely different than his father and fits well with the movie's heritage of the mandarin. The introduction of the ten rings bring a bold new perspective of the weapon from the comics and becomes one of the best powers to have in the MCU. It is a standard superhero film as there is a huge CGI battel at the end, but nonetheless done beautifully. After Marvel's mediocre first start of phase 4's Black Widow, marvel once again proves to us they still got it.",26 September 2021
yasha-52838, Beautiful movie,"As for the plot, it seemed to me that when creating it, such paintings as ""Black Panther"" and ""Spider-Man"" were taken as a basis... It feels like the creators thought: ""So, we shot ""Thor"" about white, we shot ""Black Panther"" about black, let's now shoot about Asians... and add a funny partner there like a fat man in Spider-Man?"". That's how the script for the film ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" (2021) was born.By the way, the script seemed to me somehow unfinished, it feels like they could think over more thoroughly and capitally. But apparently, the deadlines were tight and it turned out the way it turned out... Therefore, the final battle looked as absurd and ridiculous as possible... And so, the film could well claim the success of such masterpieces as ""Iron Man"" (2008), ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014).Nevertheless, there are a lot of fun and dynamic moments in the film. There are also very touching and dramatic moments available. If the script were a little more elaborated, I could even let a stingy man's tear...In general, despite all the disadvantages, I give the film a well-deserved 5 out of 5.I recommend watching it by 85%.If you're still thinking about going to the cinema or not, feel free to go. The film is not boring, dynamic, cheerful and touching. There is a conflict between fathers and children again.))So, I'm very glad I watched this movie, which reminded me a little of such a DC picture as Shazam (2019), which I also recommended for viewing.In general, if you have watched all the above Marvel and DC movies, you will definitely like this picture as well. Very beautiful and bright graphics with oriental flavor.",19 January 2022

gullymark, Phase 4 in the MCU has a bright future,"My review..
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has easily joined my top 10 list of the best movies I've ever seen... just like that. Marvel has created another masterpiece alongside Black Panther with excellent cinematography, A-1 story telling from the origin, to the subtle demolishing of Asian American stereotypes, the cameos that bring the marvel universe into unity, and even to the timing of the comic relief. These characters knew the assignment and delivered top tier performances in the choreography, plus the VFX was on Snyder's team level, imo. Arguably the best Marvel movie to date. But also one of the best Kung Fu movies in its own lane. This new Phase in the saga has a bright future if they're coming in this hot.

ash-02271, A good marvel superhero solo movie,"This movie is really good and not quit as expected. As a marvel fan, i was afraid it would end up like black widow, but it was way better. There is a good upgrade in marvel Villains compared to other solo movies. It has the marvel solo hero movie formula with marvel regular comedy which was a good hit in some points and disastrous in others. The background music is fantastic. A mix between modern and classic Chinese melodies. The acting was between ok and very good. The worst thing about this movie is the cgi especially at the last third of the movie. The world they established was wonderful but i feel like some details about some characters were vague especially regarding the mom. At the end, it is a good marvel solo movie and a quit upgrade regarding other marvel solo movies.",4 September 2021

jwraiyan, Frustratingly Bad,"This movie is so goddamn frustrating, sometimes it's great and then it just goes down the predictable hole and then it just gets worse and worse just wow.The acting was meh for the most part, nothing crazy, gets the job done but WOW Tony Leung knocked it out of the park, i didn't know him before and as soon as i saw him i felt something different and sure enough i was right, he was the best part of the film without a doubt. GREAT villain, 10/10 probably the second best villain in the MCU right after Thanos, if not just as good. Then (minor spoilers ahead) the film decided to throw him out and go for cgi monsters. The CGI in this film is good when showing small cool looking magic effects but the fight scenes and stuff were so bad. I remember seeing this smoke near the end near Shang-Chi that was so bad it felt like it came out of a b grade indian film that used a free vfx pack. Disappointingly bad CGI. The final villain was disappointing, i just can not feel for a villain that can't even talk let alone have a good past. It's just a monster that wants to kill everyone, could've just watched Godzilla and had more fun. This film could've been special, but no it just makes itself much worse than it needs to. The protagonist sucks, i did not like him (or the villain was so good that i could care less about the protagonist). His sister was sort of cool but they could've done her better and actually made her cool, she's just the ""female empowerment"" character, a forced character with forced scenes and don't get me started on the comedic friend. She's horrible, ruined the film for me even more, her jokes are bad, her voice is annoying and she gets together with the hero in the end, wow what a surprise! If they made the film just about the father I'd have given it a 10 because it was that good, sometimes it feels like 2 different people wrote this, one wrote the father's part and the other wrote the main storyline. The humor is 5/10, hits sometimes and sometimes i cringed, just no. Ben Kingsley's parts were a joy to watch. Even as a comedic character here he commands the scene, he's just too good.The soundtrack was also frustrating, the score itself was pretty damn good, it's clear that when given the tools that the composer is used to, they will make something great but WOW were the electronic themes bad, some fight scenes had edm scores and they were horrible. And the songs just WOW, they were HORRIBLE, they just don't hit the same, mixed poorly (not that strong sub basses) and just overall not as cool as Quentin Tarantino's or even Martin Scorsese's ones.The fight scenes are also like the film, frustrating, CGI parts are horrible and some shots had such weird lighting that it was hard to focus because the light behind was like a neon light/from a board and had weird colors and like the shots just weren't good enough. The fighting that was done by the mother was pretty cool and the fighting with the masked guy was pretty cool too, the one which happened in the building, the choreography was nice.The girlfriend becoming an archer was expected and it just destroyed me, it was so bad, she's supposed to be no good at life and then now she's a master archer? They trained for what, 2 days at best and Shang-Chi is a master at martial arts or something?I'm just complaining about this film this much because the villain was just ruined by this film, he was just too good and this film did not do him justice. I hate this film but can't truly hate it because of the villain.",2 January 2022

ethanthomaser, Could be better,The film was good but the final fight dragged on and the build up to the fight was too long and I got bored of the martial arts like an hour in.,7 September 2021
whyzernyan, Great movie in general!,"Great movie! I enjoyed it very much!Updates: Only mentioned the bad sides from my previous review. Let me put some good side here:
The fightings are really good! Best among all the marvel movies! A lot of long takes, really entertaining! When auntie tried to teach ShangChi, you can feel how the fighting turns from a very heavy, hard-core one into a more gentle but even powerful one. It's about cultivating the enemy's force by turning the direction of the enemy's fist. It's also the power we believe that water has: overcome the strong by applying some soft and gentle methods. Interestingly, Wong used that trick in his battle too. [BTW: when that guy took out two knives, I thought it was Loki. Can we let Loki fight with more magics? If it burns money for special effects, can we have at least some teleport tricks pls pls pls? TAT]The animal CGs are really cool! You know these animals were Phoenix, Nine-tailed fox, Kirins without saying it.some details about WenWu:1. I don't think Wenwu was being sexist to his daughter. 1000 years ago, society was generally sexist. However, when he got defeated by her wife, he showed admiration instead of being angry. It means he accepted the fact. And when the kids were young, the whole family trained together. But after Ying Li died, he stopped her training, but still, he didn't send her to learn some ""female"" stuff as the stereotypes. I think it was because Lingling reminds him of his wife, and he was trying to escape from what happened.2. Wenwu trained ShangChi not entirely for revenge. He told ShangChi when he was young, that he would like to give the ten rings if he grows strong enough. I was confused at first: why Wenwu did not seek revenge himself but told ShangChi to. Then I realized, ShangChi was there seeing her mother fight till death to protect him and his sister. Wenwu wanted ShangChi to have the power to protect himself and her sister. Wenwu made a ""mistake"" when he release the bad guys, which lead to Ying li's death. So he wanted to teach ShangChi not to make the same ""mistake"" again. He still cares about his children, but not in a way people understand, not even ShangChi and LingLing could understand.3. Wenwu put incense in front of Ying li's photo, so he knew deep inside that she was dead. But he was running away from the fact. He thought he was so powerless, that he couldn't do anything to stop her from death. He couldn't make something up for her.======================================================Some suggested changes I am thinking: Maybe when Guangbo got caught by the birds, Katy could take several shots but missed because she hurried to save him so was not able to calm down to aim. But then, she found there is only one arrow remaining, so she calms down and reminds the line auntie Ying Nan said (if she could explain to her in both languages would be better), and make the great shot at the evil dragon.Also, in the end, I think it would be better if the good dragon is not lying on the ground resting and letting the two kids drop. We believe water is the source of the dragon, and the dragon also represents kings, royals, etc. It would be great if the scene was like the dragon dropping them down while standing still in the water and dropping them using its body, and throwing them to the tail to land these kids. Then quickly go back into the lake(actually dragons live in the sea but I think any water is fine).BTW: the only downside I see as a Chinese viewer: The Chinese lines from Google translation sucks. You can understand, but it's not the words you will say in daily life if you wanna express the same thing. Maybe same as the paragraphs I just wrote above. XDD.",10 February 2022

gastonregatense," Shang-Chi, Marvel's Black Horse","Shang-Chi is a movie that nobody expected. An exemplar with which we were not familiar that, not only knew how to exploit their low expectations to the maximum extent, but also developed a structured and dynamic narrative immersed in a MCU that does not leave much room for new heroes.Shang-Chi made its first appearance in Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin's ""Special Marvel Edition # 15"" (December 1973). A Kung-Fu master created in the middle of the genre's boom in the US in the 1970s, Shang-Chi is quite a quirky character.Played by Simu Liu, the protagonist is embarked on an adventure after being intercepted by ghosts from his past. Full of action, martial arts and a very own and attractive aesthetic, the film unfolds without delay. The scenes are punctual and always add something new. Even with a sense of humor that can get heavy on certain occasions (such as when Katy makes jokes in the middle of life and death situations), Shang-Chi finds its essence, exploits it and ends with a gold ribbon leaving the door open for future aftermath.Marvel and its production team never cease to amaze me with their new films. In a difficult transition period, given the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the beginning of this new phase, the studio keeps its feet on the ground and continues a coherent thread of its interconnected universe. Regardless of the obvious mentions to the events of ""Avengers Endgame"", Marvel returns to do what it does best: including thousands of references, cameos and winks that leave the geeks like me open-mouthed and with the greed for more.The cast is incredible. I did not know any of the actors beforehand and they all dazzled me with their distinctive personalities and professional interpretations. The studio made a great work in synthetizing the oriental culture´s mythology and beliefs. However, it is true that Shang-Chi continues to be a westernized vision of Asian cultures due to its falls into stereotypes of martial arts and frequent characterizations of the Eastern world in Hollywood. Despite this and to my surprise, Shang-Chi knows how to combine the best of both worlds, using humor as its best tool and taking its time to tell the story, avoiding the rush to get to the action sequences that movies of this kind have suffered
The protagonist's arc is round and fulfilling. It has cohesion and is true to its ideals from beginning to end. Thus, the villain (excellently played by Tony Leung) only contributes to the plot and does not fall into the corner of un-memorable Marvel villains. We send you a greeting, Fake Mandarin. If it hadn't been for the blessing acting skills of RDJ, no one would remember your existence.Furthermore, the film interprets the concept of ""grays"" very well. In a franchise that is ""infantilized"" at times, Shang-Chi does not stutter in telling the hard truths of reality such as unsatisfactory employment, unreal family expectations, childhood trauma, the dilemma about murder, among others. Heroes are not pure white. They have their shortcomings, they fight with their demons and that makes them more credible, more human.With a stellar sound-track, Shang-Chi is one of Marvel's most unexpected gems. It is amazing to feel and denote the love with which these films are made and the fidelity to the source materials. For example, the main character's leitmotif is a work of art and a composition that immerses us even more in the plot. Kevin Feige deserves all the praise, he is truly a man who knows how to sell his product very well and, at the same time, sell us something with great qualitative value.After the post-credits scenes, fans only crave more and rejoice in the near future for what remains of this phase. Now with the recent release of the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, one only has to cross out the days for its premiere and admire the attention to detail that they put into the making of the films, not only as individual creations, but as a large adjoining and a special set of films. Bravo Marvel.PD: I really love Benedict Wong. Is he the ultimate man?",7 September 2021
ngkoutzi, Beautiful but lacks in storytelling,"Generally it was a pretty average movie. Like most Marvel movies, it was evident that they spared no expense when it comes to the visual effects, though some scenes could have been executed better. The fighting choreography was amazing. The movie was packed with action and beautifully synchronized action scenes from beginning to end with good soundtrack.However I found the movie to be lacking in regard to its storytelling.1. I would have liked to see a better view of the transition of Shang-Chi from trained assassin to a parking valet. It must have been a significant aspect of his life. How did his morals start shifting? We are told that killing the gang leader had a significant emotional impact but we don't see any of that.2. Katy's character (Awkafina) felt completely out of place. The fact that she doesn't really belong in that whole story could have been used as an excellent comedic opportunity which was sadly missed. Had they emphasized her random position through humor, the fact that she ends up being an important part of the story would have been an even bigger curveball.3. Other than the main villain, whose character was well constructed, most felt insignificant.",26 December 2021

samuelwongwy," Started off incredibly well, but went down hill like a roller coaster.","It was so full of potential. The opening sets a great foundation for the movie. With a fine fusion of the distinct aesthetic of ""wuxia"" (chinse martial art) and western/modern cool-ass elements, and great action parts, the movie could have became a unique and refreshing piece. Instead, it ends up as a cliche superhero story that attempts to discuss the Chinese cultural significance and understanding of family, but fails to do so in depth. Countless plot tools that barely make sense, such as Katy being able to hit at the evil creature's face, or the mysterious abrupt awaken of the dragon when summoned by Shangchi, are employed to conform to the typical expectations of a super hero movie. The costume design and mythical creatures at the end further worsened the movie experience by wiping out completely the remaining wuxia atmosphere, which in my opinion, is the best part of this movie. Shangchi and the legend of the ten rings really doesn't live up to my expectations of MCU's phase 4 works. It's watchable, but I wouldn't recommend it.",19 January 2022

TLMitch, Awesome Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. My son and I went to see it Saturday of opening weekend, and I am so glad we did. The cinematography and choreography create a visually stunning movie, with a lot of Wuxia mixed in for scenes involving the mother and her people (thing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), with some more traditional MCU fighting in others (the bus scene and the fight outside the skyscraper!). Simu Liu is adorable and wonderful, and although I am not a fan of Akwafina I will say she did a good job in this role, and Michelle Yeoh is always beautiful and engaging in everything she does. However, for me, Tony Leung was amazing. He conveys so many emotions effortlessly. He is not a remorseless killing machine, he has a purpose, and although misguided, he believe in it. He's also smoking hot so he has that going for him. This movie reminds me of Black Panther, both have strong story lines and are visually arresting, and they don't need the entire MCU to move the plot. I would highly recommend seeing it; you won't ne disappointed.",6 September 2021

nunchakupapi," A great martial arts film, compelling family story, but a run of the mill Marvel movie","*spoilers below*Shang-Chi is an interesting installation in the MCU, because it introduces fresh elements that bring an exciting performance to screen, and then turns right around and bogs itself down by reminding you that it is still a Marvel movie. It is an interesting dichotomy that I feel highlights the glaring issues in the MCU right now.Starting off with what I like: the performances in this movie are top notch. Tony Leung's as the main antagonist is by far one of my favorite MCU villain iterations in recent history, which is also a point of frustration as well, but I will get into that later. The choreography of the fight sequences deserve every praise they receive and the narratives of living up to the expectations of your family along with a family all trying to deal with the grief of loss makes for one of the more compelling stories that Marvel has told in some time.What I didn't like: Tony Leung's character has arguably one of the more compelling villain stories in the MCU. He's not just an evil asshole looking to dominate the world. He's a grieving widow, and the relationship with his children become entangled with and complicated by his overwhelming grief. So why Marvel once again chose to continue perpetuating this cycle of killing off their villains I do not understand in this instance.The point in the movie where it switches from action packed fighting choreography to CGI battle royale monster slaying is where I genuinely think the movie loses a lot of the progress it made by trying to be something different. It hits the exact same troupes of Marvel movies past, and not in a good way. Shang-Chi's conflict with his father was the most engaging plot point of the movie, and then slows down right into ""psychic demon eating dimension bad must now stop"".Some of the exposition, particularly in the middle, is a bit excessive. There was probably at least a solid 15-20 minutes that they could have shaved off the run time.Overall, it is still a fun time to be had. If you love the MCU, this is likely a film that you will thoroughly enjoy. It shines best when it tries not to be a Marvel film, but then unfortunately finds it's way right back into business as usual.",12 September 2021

It was a beautiful story.But then, everything is disappointing from that point.I am confused about the storyline. Why would Shang Chi escape and left his sister ? Its not like his dad is abusing him. He trained to become an assassin to avenge his mother AT HIS WILL. He trained until his fist is bloody AT HIS WILL too. At this point, no concrete reason why he would escape as his father is not abusive towards him too. He can just watched his mother died to protect them. Yeah hes not guilty for that. And he said hes gonna kill his father ?Yeah right. Again no concrete reason.Simu Liu is great with comedic scenes but remains stoic in the sentimental scenes. It is really hard to see him as marvel heroes as his facial expression and vibes does not support that. No father-son chemistry too with his father, Tony Leung. Think his acting is overshadowed by Tony Leung.Also father just die like that. No sentimental scenes whatsoever. Shang Chi even seems relieved his father is gone.",26 September 2021

jjisles, I'm sorry but I just don't understand the massive hype around this film,"I walked into this film excited but slightly keeping my expectations at bay, and I walked out slightly disappointed.This movie isn't necessarily bad however, I did quite enjoy it. The action choreography blew me away (bus fight scene was amazing), visuals were probably the most stunning we've ever seen in the MCU, some performances were great and characters were written well (mainly Wenwu), and the cultural appreciation in this film really makes it shine (just like Black Panther). It also introduced us to a new corner in the MCU just like Black Panther and GOTG did and I can't wait for it to be used in future films. I did appreciate that it was at least trying to stray away from the typical Marvel formula by incorporating more emotional weight during the third act climaxHowever, I had a couple issues as well. There was just some characters that I did not care for (mainly Awkwafinia's) and were written quite poorly. The film's pacing also affects it quite a bit as it moves quite slow up until the bus fight, then moves quite rapidly, and slows down when the enter the Ten Rings compound for a needlessly boring exposition scene. The second act of this film was also pretty bad and it had everything that I hate about the current MCU films/tv series. Tons of exposition that could've been explained in a more entertaining way, unnecessary jokes and scenes, and just a slog to get through. I also felt the climax dragged on quite a bit and overall, fell into the usual Marvel formula of a massive CGI fight for the third act which is so overused and boring by nowOverall, I did enjoy my time and found a lot of things to like about it, but unfortunately, just like Black Panther, this film is getting a lot of overrated praise that I think it doesn't deserve.Verdict = 7/10 (better than Black Widow at least)",5 September 2021

tristenrhee, A visual delight,"The visual effects combined with the martial arts looked very pleasing and well-executed. Another new world of fantasies and mystical creatures was enthralling. The plot was quite compelling given the dark history of Shang-Chi's father. The story around his parents' was well done too. It's a great addition to the Marvel Universe, as well as the action genre.",20 September 2021
b-57421, Entertaining,"This was a cool movie, didn't feel like a typical marvel movie but had lots of over the top action and plenty of influences from other great martial arts movies.

epklein-63815, Great fights and visuals but poor writing,"The pros to this movie are definitely representing the Asian community with very entertaining martial arts fighting scenes, and the great visuals. Although, several of the creatures in the sort of mythical land resemble Pokemon too closely, the setting there is really beautiful.The cons are definitely the writing and Marvel trying to cater to Gen Z with jokes that don't land and the two leads (Shang-Chi & Katy) falling flat. I'll admit Shang-Chi grew on me as it went on, but Katy was unbearable start to finish and easily dropped this rating because of it. Awkwafina did not fit this movie at all and was doing far too much to try to be this ""relatable laid back Gen Z"" personality to the film.Although the inclusion didnt make much sense, I found myself really liking the Mandarin and his pet Morris, as nice comedic relief, in the way that Katy tried to be.",1 January 2022
dm_oddone, What 10 rings ?,"So the title goes ""the legend of the ten rings"" when in reality the whole storyline is about Shang-Chi's father and his quest to get his dead wife back and as a side-story we have the nemesis between the People of Ta Lo and the Darkness Dweller.They give absolutely little to no backround about that, though it's the main reason why Shang Chi transitions from his life in San Francisco to his superhero persona. They give very little backround information on his parents story and about his father, who is the bearer of the ten rings and most importantly NO BACKROUND about the ten rings apart from the fact that they don't know anything about them.They could have gone into a little more detail about them trough Shang-Chi's father.... He could have explained his son about them or give any piece of information. Hence I believe the title is wrong, because the movie is anything but about those rings-bracelets.Also it's a bit far fetched, even for Marvel, that as a child Shang Chi lived in some ancient castle in a remote valey with his parents and sister and that his father went grocery shopping while his mom fought off some gangster's mob all by herself.... It could have been portraied much better because it's the root of all the story.Also the chemistry between the cast isn't fabulous and the main actor does not have that *sparkle* that will make him stand out and wanna search him up.Over all the visuals do not dissapoint, but the plot is sort of flat, it has almost no climax, no drama or major turning points and it's played out in a ""casual"" way. It simply isn't epic. Worth to watch it in IMAX though.",15 October 2021

After seeing it I wish I hadn't, just another Marvel trash film, that completely misses the point of the characters, the ten rings are reduced to being some king of crappy energy whip things and the cast as stale and uninteresting.

adam_brody_76, Another Marvel movie worth watching,"Another Marvel movie that is worth watching and, if possible, in a movie theater. Before Feige and Marvel presented this future film project, I did not know anything about this character or the entire universe around him. That is why, when I was coming through the movie theater, my expectations wasn´t high at all and the truth is at the end I felt so happy and wanting to follow more adventures of this new character that Marvel has given us. This movie goes through many genres, truth be told, fantasy, science fiction, comedy, drama, action and a lot of sense of adventure during the slightly more than two and a quarter hours of footage. Great action and fight scenes, marvelous set-pieces, very well choreographed.",5 September 2021
zlatni_ljiljan, crouching tiger hidden dragon Marvel stile,"The action is not bad and the story is good too but it doesnt belong in the marvel universe.The movie in it self looks like a promotion for Asia.The movie feels like its forced politicaly.I would rather see that one of the big heroes gets an asian face/character than this Anime show.I mean ofc they have to start during asian greatness and all that but the rings where are they from? How did they get to asia? And then we have the whole batman story, parent dies kid turns in too assasin.And during whole film they promote the family bond.",12 November 2021
krnrtat, Could've been better,"Don't get me wrong I liked the movie, but I may have put too much expectation into it. A lot of bad reviews have said the story was lacking, but I think the direction was lacking. The opening montage was a missed opportunity to highlight some history and maybe add some emotion. I mean Disney was able to make you laugh and cry all in one Up montage. Tony Leung really lit up the screen. I kinda wish Simu Lui spent a little more time refining his Kung fu moves. I'm nitpicking, but he was a bit stiff. Could've done without Akwafina. Some jokes fell flat for me, but I'm not a die hard Marvel fan. And lastly the disrespect of a magical mythical creature was icky to me. Not even Harry Potter steps on the face of a dragon. Overall it was good, but could've definitely used a lot of refining. Tony Leung mentioned in an interview that due to the halt of filming during COVID they had to rush to finish and it really shows.",7 September 2021
merfinmehmed, Nothing to do with Marvel,"It could have been a movie created outside the Marvel saga, this has nothing to do with Marvel, very disappointed, it's worth watching while cooking or scrolling on reddit, there is no need to be fosused, very bad acting, no emotion.

ashishmannoj, Not good writing,I can't connect to any character in this movie at all. Kung fu actions is good. But there is a lot of movie on Kung fu. This is totally trash movie that put a question on mind.... why why why ??? Why his father not care of his family and why main hero want to kill himself father too. Why main villain of this movie not killed in previous fight when it faught he is not so powerful.Conclusion of this movie writers want to kill sang chi's father and sang chi too.

How does Shang Chi learn his mother's martial art in 7 min? Why does aquafinas character not feel like it fits in the entire time? It feels like she didn't fit.

seanrkhanna, Overrated,"Very generic Chinese movie with cringy scenes and generic plot.

I guess it's alright to watch if you are going to pay a couple bucks, but don't expect anything crazy.",25 November 2021
devashishism, Best ever new character launch movie,"I loved the movie. It's very high on entertainment value and achieves a lot you would expect from a new character.Firstly, the storyline wasn't great but neither common yet it was sufficient to establish all the characters. And then hand to hand combat sequences were beautifully choreographed in 3 totally different settings - bus, macau, and at chinese wakanda. Great to see that almost 60% of movie time was filled with action sequences and remaining also was mostly action related drama. Background score, set design, and overall theme felt fresh.I rate it high because comparatively previous marvel launch movies were not that great, but definitely this one also lacks on few aspects:the lead isn't charming or charismatic in appearance. This is his first big break so maybe it improves later when he is more confident.The antagonist is easy. There was literally not a moment where you feel the protagonist is struggling. Probably he wasn't supposed to be underdog, but his drive and passion to fight was not convincing. Same for the antagonist.The rings meaning or power is not yet explained which is a bummer. I am not sure what to expect from them. Also 10 rings are kind of dumb weapon.Side characters/friends are supposed to bring comic relief however here it was pretty average.Small thing but the lead do not have super human strength or body, yet he can do those thing. Maybe more is revealed later but this is same problem as Black Widow.-Suit also doesn't add power. This bit was disappointing because in Marvel generally suit serves a purpose.",6 September 2021
hayleythurston-50080," Surprised, but really enjoyed it!","Since captain marvel I've really struggled to enjoy anything disney is putting out.

I would definitely recommend it.",14 November 2021

ycallistaa, It's not as bad as you read,"I enjoyed watching this from the beginning to end. It was kind of a little bit slow in the middle of the movie.

I love how they speak Chinese, and only speak English because they learned languages.I can accept the jokes. Even the cheesy one made me smile.Over all, I feel good getting out of the movie theater and have no regrets.Coming home reading the bad reviews, just give me chills and negative vibes for me so I have to sign out.",2 October 2021
Ursula-Scheer, How did the movie get a rating of 7+!?,"Boy is this movie's plot all over place. We tried, we really tried to enjoy, but oh man. It was filled with goofy, exaggerated action scenes, really, really bad CGI and the plot was probably there? There were cameos EVERYWHERE. Almost as if Disney tried to remind us who of the b- and c-characters is still alive and kicking add about to appear in one of the upcoming movies. But truly, the movie felt as if those bad Chinese fantasy action flicks had teamed with a knock off version of Need for speed with only crappy cars. It was insanely tailored to the Chinese market which wouldn't have been a bad thing, if Disney hadn't copied the Transformers IV strategy of going Chinese. As it is, this is the first MCU movie we find even less than mediocre. This movie makes the Incredible Hulk and Spiderman 3 look like good movies. I guess the era of exclusively great MCU movies is finally over. We're going to enjoy it's send off by watching the frankly brilliant Hawkeye show, at least so far. I guess it's a good thing no movie theatre around our town tried to show this movie. Otherwise, we'd been really annoyed because of the wasted money.",26 November 2021
mzj-31967, My personal feelings as a Chinese viewer,"It's been really polemic in China because of its original comics' racism. But to the movie itself, i can see Marvel's efforts to avoid it and its intentions to please Chinese audiences. And it truly makes sense. Hearing a large amount of mandarin dialogues was the biggest surprise for me. There are also many Chinese traditional legendary animals from Shan Hai Jing appeared. The fight scenes and special effects were really amazing, better than any others in the Marvel universe.",1 October 2021

djwhitey, Better than black panther with non of the hype,"Black panther was renowned for what the film did for the black community, it was nominated for Oscars aswell as winning some.The film was good but for me it was over hyped for more reasons than one, that is where the film was let down as it is not one of the better in the MCU but is celebrated as one.Whereas shang chi, delivers on almost every point just like black panther it's cast is mainly Asian, the film score is good throughout and the cinematography and action scenes are up there with the best the MCU has to offer.Yet zero hype, zero media coverage about what it has done for the Asian community, yet this film shines and stands on its own as one of the best MCU installments to date, well played.",12 November 2021
danielortgiess," Superb special fx poor acting, humor far from funny",I just don't understand why this flick got such high ratings. You can go crazy with special effects but if the acting is poor and the attempts to bring some humor u can trow this whole concept in the bin. The humor is what makes me connect with the actor's in most of the marvel films. This was really lame as and it made me want to leave the theater everytime a lame ass attempt to have some sort of funny dialogue. The main characters are not very strong characters. Most of the dialogue was annoying. I just don't understand other reviews and why this film is rated so good. Its not only about special effects.,23 September 2021
calvinlimsk, It does represent the Chinese culture in a right way.,"The first 40 minutes is basically just like a pretty decent asian-american experience. After that, it uniquely brings you into the adventure of Chinese (asian) culture that you've never experience before in an asian-american film. It is action-packed but definitely breathable and whole lot more of family-drama, emotional moment that we chinese definitely understand. It does represent a lot of our culture in a right way with a straight forward yet engagging way of story telling. One of the things that impressed me the most is how much mandarin language is spoken and how every little details is shown that represent Chinese culture. This is definitely a fresh Marvel's movie and you shouldn't miss.",28 October 2021

jnikhvvpc," Lots of New, Yet Same Old Same Old","Shang Chi brings a lot of new dynamics to the MCU that have not been done in any of the subsequent Marvel movies to this point. The fight choreography with fantastic martial arts action being beautifully captured and edited to perfection, the accompanying score that really paces the scenes well, and at times breath taking cinematography. However, particularly in the third act, it tends to fall back on the tried and true Marvel formula that is become tiresome to even someone like me who is a huge Marvel fanboy. The Mandarin is one of the greatest MCU villains we have ever seen. I wish this was the true Iron Man 3 villain. However there is comic relief and exposition characters accompanying our heroes throughout much of the film that takes the bite out of the stakes. The third act continues with the faceless army versus B characters complete with a huge CGI spectacle at the end. You can seek how this borrows from other firms prior, particularly Black Panther. A fun watch, but unfortunately not the home run they were going for.",19 September 2021

My most favourite fighting scenes in MCUI enjoy every sences in this movie. It's shallow but enjoyable. Super easy to digest and to predict.

ruchikasharma-06269, Great movie with just a small fault,"Marvel Shang chi review
Pros:-
The fight scenes in this movie are next level cool
Weapons and costume design is really good
Plus Shang chi's sisters ka weapon is really badass
This movie is really cool and doesn't take itself too seriously
This is a really fun movie with great fight scenes
Personally, I didn't like Katy that much but it's my personal opinion and not a problem
Shang chi is really badass but his dad is my fav character in the whole movie
He really cool and I'm really impressed from his dad
I think plot is really cool aur the way Shang chi's rings connect with kamar taj is also fascinating(anything related to doctor strange is cool)
Seeing the ten rings in fights and other scenes is just really cool
Shang chi's cgi is mind blowing aur in the last fight, the CGI was just brilliant
Cons:-
the Ending was really cliche and generic
It's was almost anticlimactic, like if it was just too easy
Shang chi is a great movie besides the ending, (it's ending was really similar to aquaman's end)
Shang chi's sister was a really cool character and it was a shame because her role in the film is frighteningly less
But besides the ending, there aren't a lot of faults in the movie
Overall shang chi:-8/10
If the ending would have been a bit unpredictable and just a little cooler, it would have been a 9.5/10
But overall it's a good movie that I would suggest watching.",24 December 2021

Anton-dahlstrom508, Taking itself too seriously,"Sure, I'm not a marvel superfan. But I watch some of the movies. And they are usually quite fun and digestible. But The Legend of the Ten Rings just takes itself too seriously. The story is quite simple, but they have padded the runtime a lot. The serious tone in most of the scenes starts to drag after an hour of continuous setup and slow/easy moviemaking.The human bad guys are not also not very scary and mostly serve as a way for the movie to transport itself to the climax. In general, this movie suffers a lot from ""punch-power creep"", where all characters seem to be impervious to most things that would kill regular humans. So a punch is only dangerous when the plot deems it to be.The CGI is... alright? Some sections are definately rough (the maze of trees in the beginning, some of the water shots, and an overabundance of glowing things).There are some redeeming parts of this movie though. The scene where the dad/Xu Wenwu meets the mother is quite beautiful and engaging! I quite enjoyed the end fight over the water as well. The acting is quite alright all around: Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Awkwafina/Katy were great and saved this movie for me.",12 November 2021
