0,Purchased this product advertised as fully unlocked. Inserted my sim card and it did not work. Contacted my service provider and they checked my IMEI number and it reported that the phone was still locked by the original carrier. Phone came in good condition just couldn't use any service provider.,Negative,
1,I was feeling a bit skeptical after I placed my order but I was proven wrong! The phone looks brand new besides some very minimal/ light scratches (almost impossible to notice) and the battery life is still at 100%. I also like that there was a screen protector on the phone,Positive,
2,Phone was not unlocked could it use it,Negative,
3,The screen came cracked and popped out of the frame. Hopefully the return process goes smoothly.,Negative,
4,Be careful mine had a scratch on screen very small but still their Used. People dont want used I phones with scratches,Negative,
5,"This is the best experience I have ever had with buying a renewed phone. The phone came in it�s original box with original charger and cable and the phone looks excellent, not one scratch on it absolutely beautiful and the battery health was at 100%. I definitely recommend the seller GoOverstock, as I will definitely be buying from them again.",Positive,
6,"I fought it for the longest time but I finally gave in and upgraded to the iPhone 11 from the iPhone 7. I looked other places online, but the price was way out of my price point. I felt comfortable buying this phone from Amazon because it was certified refurbished and I�m still happy that I did.",Positive,
7,The box didn�t come with ear phones. The phone kept turning off by itself after set up. Some apps had to be deleted before they�d quit shutting off on their own.,Neutral,
8," I just wanna tell everybody this is NOT A SCAM!!!! This phone is so amazing, great battery life, Face ID everything. Unfortunately mine didn�t come in an iPhone box but I was too much worried about that but it did come w/ a charger . Please get this phone don�t let any of these reviews scare you! I will be doing a month review on this phone for more updates. Brand new and unlocked I�m paired with cricket so everything transferred over so easily!",Positive,
9,"Working well so far, looks new.",Positive,
10,"My iPhone came with a big scuff on the corner (aluminum frame) and a small (not really noticible) scratch on the front and back of the phone. I got the 64 gb product red unlocked iPhone 11 which was, I believe a Verizon unlocked phone. My phone came in the iPhone 11 apple box with a original apple charger and original apple brick. When I set up my phone I just put in my T-Mobile sim and the phone started working with my data. I did not need to get it activated or anything.",Positive,
11,"My phone re start over and over again, that's so sad because the i phone looks like new",Negative,
12,"I received my phone a day early and it came exactly as I imagined. I was a little nervous buying a refurbished phone on the internet, but I truly have no complaints. The phone came in perfect, like new condition and has been working great with my carrier and in general. Came with a charger and charging block as mentioned in the description. It also came with a screen protector that was already put on the screen! That was an awesome and much appreciated touch. There�s also 60 day warranty and free returns just in case something were to happen. I�m incredibly pleased. Would definitely recommend to anyone!",Positive,
13,"Very disappointed with this purchase: Was same price as a brand new Apple I-Phone. This phone had 2 deep scratches on screen, did not come with earphones, was not an Apple charging cord, (although it had a sticker saying it was), was not an Apple charger. Also was never able to install I cloud.",Negative,
14,"been using iphones for a a long time. i needed a new one & saw this online for a good price. i dont have any complaints it works great. camera quality is amazing. it came with a charger, but *did not come with headphones* and it did not come in the classic �iPhone� packaging which didnt bug me but other people might care. i definitely recommend but if you want the headphones id buy them separately.",Positive,
15,"Amazon renewed phone. Was expecting minor cosmetic issue as described, however there was a decent size mark above the volume down button and the volume down button does not function properly. Contacted amazon and the seller and have not gotten this resolved.",Negative,
16,Don�t trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word. Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I�ve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone. I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.,Negative,
17,I haven�t had the phone for 2 weeks and now the power button isn�t working and now the seller isn�t responding !!!,Negative,
18,"IPhone was shipped in two-day delivery. The box inside of a FedEx bag came opened but the FedEx bag itself was untouched, so I presume it was not completely closed before sealing the bag. The phone came with no scratch or sign of usage at all, a screen protector (nice touch) and generic certified usb cable and charger. No earphones as described. Battery life is 100%. So far it looks and works good. Im only a little concerned that it gets quite hot in the back. Im only doing the math and believe $639.99 is still a high price for a refurbished. If you want replace the generic stuff by purchasing an original charger + cable + earpods + connector, the total price will go beyond a brand new phone.",Positive,
19,Great product. Looks and works exactly like new,Positive,
20,"""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice"" is is a false statement in their add for Amazon. When I received the phone there was a paper inside the box saying not compatible with Sprint or Boost Mobile. I happen to use one of those carriers, and rather then erasing all my info that I already had transferred from my old phone to the new phone and mailing the phone back I chose to switch carriers which was an additional pain. So BuySPRY won in the end but I will never purchase from them again.",Negative,
21,"I purchased this iPhone 11 because it said it was unlocked. I have always owned unlocked iphones and never had troubles with them. I live in Guatemala. This iPhone 11 was working for a few days but all of the sudden ""stopped"" recognizing my SIM card. As you can see in the video the issue is not my SIM card because it works in my old and unlocked iPhone 8. Since I am not in the USA I lost almost $600. Beware, don't buy this product. It is a complete scam.",Negative,
22,Excelente tel�fono y muy buena la c�mara lo recomiendo 100%,Positive,
23,My son loved this phone. We had no problems setting anything up. Worked perfect. In brand new apple box as well,Positive,
24,I just received this phone on Friday(3 days earlier than expected)and it is absolutely lovely. It came in a generic box with an apple compatible charger and cable. No scratches or imperfections that I can see at this time . The battery capacity is 100%. It looks and works like a brand new device.,Positive,
25,"Every things right, battery came with %100 capacity, and it arrived 4 days early through FedEx, i got the color and device storage I ordered. Theres a few scratches on the bare screen which prove its used, (i peeled the screen protector it came with off so i could put my tempered glass one on) but theyre invisible when a screen protector is on. Phone is lighting fast and im just so happy! I had some doubts when buying this phone because there weren't enough reviews on it and it was used. But its entirely like new, although you dont get the unboxing experience of buying it brand new, and earbuds arent included. Im happy i got a discount and that i didnt buy a new one and just have this one sit around and get scrapped for parts or something. I honestly dropped $690 bucks on this thing and i was gonna go ballistic if it didnt show up, but it came early and im so relieved and happy with it, its absolutely beautiful. Also the battery life on this for an iphone is great, i came from a 2016 SE, so a big change.",Positive,
26,"I shopped around a lot for a renewed, refurbished iPhone 11. This was not the cheapest but really close. The selling point for me is that it comes with a 90 day warranty and refund policy and is sold through Amazon Prime. We received the phone 4 days ago. Upgraded and transferred everything from the iPhone 7 to the 11 flawlessly. Plus, the phone had no cosmetic issues at all. It looks brand new. We have bought a refurbished iPhone 7 and now this 11. Both worked perfectly.",Positive,
27,The phone comes in the original iPhone box which was a nice bonus and difference between other companies that send unlocked iPhones in normal cardboard boxes and it works perfectly,Positive,
28,"Work totally fine so far, I�m satisfied with the functionality. But It didn�t come with earphones.",Positive,
29,"As far as buying this product from this specific seller, my experience has been great! Nothing to complain about. There were no scratches in the glass display, not to mention there weren�t any on the back glass or camera lenses either. But as far as the phone itself, I�m an android person but my first smartphone happened to be an iPhone and I had gone through a couple generations of them. I�m pleased to say that this device feels great but, it�s still an iPhone and to that, I mustn�t give a full 5 star review. Android gang.",Positive,
30,"This is not a scam!! I repeat this is not a scam! I love iPhones, I always want a nice good working phone that I know won�t take a dump in me because me being a single mom I need to beable to keep in touch with school and grandpa so if anything happens I�m aware right away! I love this phone! No scratches no dings! It�s like brand new!!! It looks new! And works like new!!! Comes with a screen protector! I am in love!!! The battery capacity is 100%! And it�s a killer deal for the price of this kind of phone!! It�s well worth it and it came in two days with my Amazon prime earlier than it said it would! You will be happy! I highly recommend!",Positive,
31,Bought refurbished I�m assuming only open box as the item seemed 100%brand new would recommend the seller,Positive,
32,It's ok,Positive,
33,"This phone is great! (Please excuse the somewhat blurry pics, I have shaky hands) The battery health was already at 100% and its has barely any cosmetic damage. Save for a super tiny little nick at the top which is barely noticeable unless I shine a camera directly at the area. Also, the phone came preinstalled with a screen protector! I guess its a bit of a minus that it doesnt come with headphones, but I already have airpods, so that doesn�t bother me. It�s something to keep in mind when you purchase anything from Amazon Renewed. The phone came in four days early too which is dope.",Positive,
34,So pleased. The phone came with a screen protector on it already even! And we�ll placed! No scuffs. Phone is seriously like brand new. Battery is 99%. I was skeptical after a bunch of 1 star reviews but figured I would try it because there is a 90 day guarantee and return. Don�t feel scared about this deal. Try it out. You will be pleased. I got the black 256gb unlocked iPhone 11 just FYI.,Positive,
35,"I have never bought a used phone before and I've never bought one online. I always went through my carrier. However, this time I was ready to save some money and get an unlocked phone. I was a little nervous but I did some research and then took a risk since I had time to return it for a full refund if it didn't work out. The phone came in perfect condition and works like new. To me, I can't tell the difference between this phone and a brand new one! I've been using it for about 4 days and I've had no issues! Definitely worth the risk.",Positive,
36,Great phones... I initially bought one for my daughter and ended up ordering one for myself,Positive,
37,"Well I got the iPhone 11 yesterday and it currently right now will shut off every 5-10 mins , I have tried multiple times to contact the carrier and they haven�t emailed me back or nothing which I spent 700$ on a phone I�d like to get atleast a phone I can have a conversation on .. I don�t even want my money back I just want my phone fixed because it�s honestly a great phone but I think you should get a better technician that works on your phones cause I even called Apple to see what they recommend I do (that�s what they said ab the technician ) but I�m just disappointed I was so excited now I just feel ripped off ):",Negative,
38,I can�t send messages to anyone who doesn�t have an iPhone. The power button doesn�t work correctly and often times Siri doesn�t respond. The only way to get the issue corrected is to be without a phone until the seller sends me a new one. I�d never buy again or from this company.,Negative,
39,"For the most part everything is okay
Different parts of the screen won�t work during certain times. So I have to lock and unlock my phone constantly Nd hope it will work after While writing this review I can�t even hit the bottom right corner to add punctuation unless it comes up from autocorrect When I contacted the company they told me to hard reset it and it should work after. That worked for less than a day and I don�t want to have to hard reset my phone every other day for it to work when I spent seven hundred dollars. Can�t even use numerical characters. Update I reached out to them again saying their advice didn�t work and haven�t received a response and it�s been a week",Negative,
40,"This was an amazing buy from Kiss Electronics. No issues with phone operation so far, only just received & setup. Was packaged nicely & came with an adapter and a charging cable (no headset). Iphone product Red body was in good condition. Small scratches on upper corner . Very very happy with purchase",Positive,
41,Works great.,Positive,
42,I am absolutely happy with my purchase! I�ve gone through the reviews and was ready to order right after. The only thing is my battery health was at 84% as I seen others with 100% which is fine by me. It�s nothing to go get a new battery when and if that time comes. As you see in the pictures the phone is in great condition annnndddd it�s unlocked so you can use any phone service for it. I�m digging the picture quality especially after upgrading from the iPhone X to this. What a difference a upgraded phone makes! It came with a cute case plus a charger. If you�re looking into this phone I�d say go for it. I�m on day 1 and I�m excited!!! (UPDATE! April 18th) I�m 1 month in with the phone and it�s still working great no issues at all.,Positive,
43,"A BIG thank you for selling iPhones on Amazon! I wanted this phone so bad and couldn�t get my hands on it anywhere unlocked. I am so glad I could buy in through Amazon, This is how we get everything so we knew it was reliable. The phone did not come in an apple iPhone box, but a box just the same with a charger no headphones. But I could care less because all I wanted was the phone. Works great, you wouldn�t even know the difference. I have since told friends and family to do the same when looking for a new phone. Plus it was much cheaper then I found it anywhere else. Very pleased that I got exactly what I wanted for an amazing deal!",Positive,
44,"After only 3.5 months the phone is completely dead and will not charge. Took to Apple store and was told it would have to be replaced. WTH! Ordered and received early October 2020. Started having charging issues last week and now it is completely dead. And wouldn't you know it is past the return date by a mere 12 days. Come on Amazon, you sold me this product you need to stand behind it or at least replace or refund something that lasts only days longer than the return window. BS!",Negative,
45,"No scratches or damage on the screen, or, for that matter, any part of the phone! SO happy I took the plunge and bought the phone, it has been well worth it so far!
-no scratches or dents anywhere
-battery capacity 100%
-unlocked & everything as advertised",Positive,
46,"Apple iPhone 11, 64GB, Red - Fully Unlocked (Renewed) arrived in only two days nicely packaged and looks brand new! Only one, barely noticeable scratch on the screen and a very tiny scratch on the side that you can notice if you hold it really close to your face. Overall I'm very satisfied. I've had the phone for 24 hours now, works really well and fast and battery is still going since I charged it yesterday, it's at currently at 29%. If any unusual changes occur in the near future I'll update my review but I doubt it since the phone is in near perfect condition",Positive,
47,"My sister is absolutely in love with this phone she was so surprised when I gave it to her, very fast shipping packaging was great.",Positive,
48,camera came slightly scratched but overall a good purchase,Positive,
49,"It�s a refurbished phone I don�t mind that it didn�t come in an original box, the phone itself is in very very good shape, I was so skeptical about buying this phone from amazon since it�s my first time buying a phone online but it is in very good condition! No cracks no scratches ! Looks brand new !! Seems to be working fine for now hopefully it stays that way I just need to see if it�ll work with my carrier, it came with a screen protector which was a nice touch :) really happy with the product. UPDATE!!!! After a Month or two of having it, it still works really great! Batter life is long and it charges super fast. Highly recommend",Positive,
50,"Slight micro scratch on the screen, but overall good condition for an open box",Positive,
51,"It came in perfect condition, no scratches, nothing was wrong. The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that, it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there. So it's crucial to remember your contacts.",Positive,
52,"Certified. Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.
All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.
Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right? Do not buy from this organization if you plan to gift. Please do your loved one a favor and keep BUYSRY's mediocre business and risk to yourself. Just buy her something new you cheapskate! Good luck and stay healthy.",Negative,
53,"Got my phone in two days rather than five standard shipping days! I was happy it came sooner than expected! I was nervous about ordering a renewed phone online because I didn�t want to spend $700 on a phone not knowing if it was damaged or not, but I�m happy to say it came like brand new with no dents or scratches!! I�m so happy I made this choice because it saved me almost $300 from ordering on the apple website. Would definitely take the chance if your looking to buy the phone from them. The phone came in a different box with just a charger, FYI.",Positive,
54,"The lock screen is flickering and getting blurry .. everything else seems to be fine , I tried to restart it again but it�s not working",Negative,
55,"This review is based on the renewed status of the phone and not of the iPhone itself. I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal. Thankfully Amazon has a longer return period if the phone doesn't work out for you, but I only needed a few minutes with the phone to know that I'd rather buy a new phone from Apple for $100 more.",Negative,
56,I only dislike that I didn�t receive headphones with the order. Everything else was on point,Positive,
57,I received a phone that had a crack in the screen which wasn�t that big of a deal but the something was off with camera though compared it my boyfriends phone who ordered the same one from Apple and I think it was replaced with a different one and the biggest problem with the phone was that it�s kept restarting I thought maybe I was doing it by accident but no it would turn off while I didn�t have it my hand but using my AirPods . I also had problems trying the return the phone as the shipping label they sent roundly be taken by fedex and I had to pay myself all around you�d be better off buying new phone from Apple it ended up being cheaper .all around I paid $780 for the phone unlocked from Apple don�t waste your money,Negative,
58,"I�m pleasantly surprised with this transaction. I�m a true skeptic and regularly conduct extensive research when making this type of purchase. The phone doesn�t come in original packaging and the cord and wall adapter are definitely not Apple products. The usb connection on the wall adapter had was bent and i could not slide the usb into the adapter....that was tossed into the trash. With that said, the product I care most about was the phone itself and it is exactly as advertised. It stared right up and went through start up process. My entire phone was transferred within an hour and I was on my way. I�ve been using it for about 4 days now and the battery life is strong and all the features work perfectly (no sticky buttons, etc). I would definitely recommend this vendor if you only care about getting the iPhone as it�s supposed to be. If you�re concerned about packaging and having a �uniquely� Apple experience, you may want to pay the additional $400 at the Apple store.",Positive,
59,"Not gonna lie, after reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy a Renewed phone, but in the end I'm super glad I did it! My phone came a day earlier than I expected, was nicely packaged, and already had a screen protector applied (no bubbles!). Set up and transfer from my old 6+ was simple. Got my apple watch transferred over. Cameras all work great, face ID has no issues so far, etc. Obviously it's been less than a day, but so far, so good!",Positive,
60,"Not gonna lie i was a little skeptical at first, im like dang did i really spend that much money on this what if its a scam? but im more than happy with the results. Battery health is on 100, phone is in perfect condition, came with new charger (no headphones tho), and there was no trouble transferring data from my old phone to the new one. I didnt even need to call my carrier to turn on the phone, just simply placed my sim card in. Definitely recommend this (if you dont mind the price lol).",Positive,
61,"The phone came in with scratches on it but after I put the screen protector on you can�t see it and whenever you put the screen protector on it�s gone have some like bubbles I put it on over and over and the bubbles seems to not go away but, overall it�s good I guess it doesn�t have YouTube but I�m satisfied I guess but, the price should�ve been lower than this since it�s refurbished and still come in the mail kinda mess up. The face recognition works fine battery was fine the setup was good only took 5 mins.",Neutral,
62,Cheapest iPhone 11 with 128gb that I could find online and I did ALOT of searching. Great buy! Love my new phone and the camera quality is amazing,Positive,
63,It�s refurbish but I got all brand new (apple box with original charger but missing the ear plug),Positive,
64,The phone came in great condition. It works great! No lag! No issues! The battery life is great as well. I�m happy with the quality of the phone. I�m happy with my purchase! :),Positive,
65,The product came in a timely fashion. I like that it came with a charger no headset though charger not original but can�t complain for the price you are paying great deal and the phone is great condition,Positive,
66,"Honesty is greatly appreciated these days. They delivered exactly what they promised: The phone arrived timely and it looked brand new. Everything worked smoothly as I expected. Unfortunately, I wasn't very thrilled about the phone size because I have always liked larger phones, so I contacted the seller for a refund. They kindly instructed me as to how to return the item in order to get a full refund back on my card. So far, so good. No complaints and I would definitely do business with these people again.",Positive,
67,I paid $ 720 but the screen was scratched. Should not be bought at this shop.,Negative,
68,"I was a bit skeptical about buying an iPhone renewed off amazon instead of new but my worries were soon gone after the iPhone came in without any damages and at 100% battery health. Besides not getting the official iPhone box with the earphones, I still received a working charger/power adapter & a screen protector installed on the iPhone already. Very satisfied with my purchase.",Positive,
69,Not user friendly. I might have to return it. I have to learn how to clean it before I send it back as it loaded my pictures from my other phone.,Negative,
70,"Just got my iPhone 11 today and I was so anxious of using it but had to wait 2 hours for everything to set up. After that a message popped up saying that my phone screen may not be genuine so I freaked out because it supposed to be all ortigal? Right well apparently the screen is not authentic at all... hope my review and evidence works to y�all. I scanned my phone with a program called 3utools, hope it works.",Neutral,
71,"So I gave the phone another chance after it kept glitching on me but it�s definitely a no. The phone already came cracked on the side where the lock button is, I guess that�s why the phone won�t power off for me to complete the activation. Second after finally getting the phone to activate after letting it die out for a day because you have to turn a phone off & on for proper activation it finally started to work. I had gotten a screen protector & phone case for this iPhone 11 all for it not to work. After four days of having the phone i could no longer have a conversation on the phone. I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn�t hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed. When I was on FaceTime the front camera was glitching on the video. I�ve had enough of this phone. Called straight talk this morning to have my minutes transferred to my other phone, will be taking my screen protector & case off && taking my new sims card out to return this phone TODAY for a full refund. This is my second time purchasing a phone from Amazon & BOTH times the phones were defects or glitches how you wanna say. I will NOT be ordering anymore phones online again. First time shame on you, second time shame on me & there will NOT BE A THIRD. People please read these reviews carefully because the person selling you the phone do NOT care. They fix these phones that�s broke & try to sell them thinking they�ve found a dummy because most won�t return the phone but I had a little time today & will have more when I get my refund today. I�ll give the phone one star because the phone takes nice back pictures but THATS IT.",Negative,
72,All they did was replace the glass. The sides of the phone are all scratched up not refurbished at all and the cables included are all aftermarket... not really pleased with the way the phone looks at all. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a new one.,Negative,
73,The Face ID do not work I tried everything to fix it In wouldn�t buy from dis seller again,Negative,
74,"I had been looking at Amazon renewed iPhones for a couple of weeks but was skeptical about ordering a renewed phone. I decided on an iPhone XR and saw this iPhone 11 for about $30 more and put it in my cart and procrastinated ordering it for a couple of hours partly because there were no reviews at the time. I decided to go for it since it could be sent back. I checked the tracking info the day it was suppose to be delivered and saw the review posted the day before and became very concerned I had made a bad decision and was prepared for disappointment when it arrived. The battery was completely dead and when I put it on the charger it didn�t look like it was charging at all and that concerned me but after 30 minutes it had enough battery to power on. I haven�t had any issues so far, and it�s just as good as if I had bought it brand new. There are no cosmetic flaws anywhere on it. Very pleased with it so far!",Positive,
75,"Received phone. It looked good, then after charging it overnight the screen was a jumble of blurred vertical lines. Amazon insisted we had to deal with the seller. Could not clear the phone as the screen didn�t work. Communication from the seller was scripted, they never really answer your questions. Sent phone back to seller. They refunded 1% and kept 99% as a restocking fee! Then we had to force Amazon to deal with it to get a full refund. Horrible seller, buyer beware!!!",Negative,
76,It was perfect! Even had a screen protector on it,Positive,
77," ** Edit **
The seller provided a copy of the report showing all components were OEM, so it was simply an oversight on the Quality Control of the reseller - which is understandable, since it was only noticed upon angled inspection.

*****

This phone actually looked amazing - barely any scratches on the case and the screen appeared wonderful.... UNTIL it's held at an angle. See video clip of how rippled / warbled the screen was - obviously a non-OEM quality replacement job. And likely a poorly completed job by the seller.

when applying screen protector(s) it became horribly noticeable - the protector couldn't fully adhere, leaving bubbles that couldn't rub out because the underlying screen wasn't smooth. Disaster - waste of 2 protectors.

Sad part - this was our 2nd refurb phone, the first had the original glass - but was pretty scratched up. Not worth $500 as a refurb. Returned, purchased from a different seller. Lesson learned - just spend $50 more and buy it new from Apple.com",Neutral,
78,"i desperately needed a new phone. my phone was starting to give out not only because my old phone was outdated (iPhone 7+), but it was starting to have so many problems. trust me, i did so much research and looking up what type of new phone i should get. i looked for months on end while my old phone was still in good condition. the iPhone 11 was honestly the best purchase i got, it�s so new and improved that i don�t ever wanna switch back to Samsung. i�ve gotten used to the no home button that when i first got it, i didn�t know how to use it

best part was that i got the iPhone 11 unlocked and it works with my straight talk so i�m pretty pumped about that.

thank you!!",Positive,
79,"The iPhone 11 my son bought from BuySPRY technically works in the sense of being a very expensive digital camera and ipod, but not as a phone. In august, we were contacted by our phone service provider Xfinity Mobile who said the phone was flagged for being from Asia, possibly counterfeit, and therefore unusable on their system. Checking with Verizon, ATT, and T-Mobile with IMEI, the answer was the same - nobody wants this phone on their system. We contact BuySPRY who asked for the IMEI, which I immediately sent, and they have ghosted us since. We are now out of the return window, and my son has wasted his money.",Negative,
80,"If there was a way to leave a 0 star, I would. I got the phone in the mail, super excited to get it up and running, and it wouldn't turn on. I called Apple and was on a call with them for 30 mins and they couldn't help me get the phone on either. Needless to say, I'll be returning the phone without even getting a chance to use it.",Negative,
81,"All is great with the phone! Came in two days. It was a great upgrade from my 8 plus, very adorable and was delivered to my door in two days conveniently instead of waiting in a Apple store like usual! Will buy again from amazon.",Positive,
82,"Keep in mind these items are refurbished, which means someone else has had them - it may have a screen cover or already have knicks and chips. Based on my experience - there's a huge chance it could have been opened and repaired. If the phone was opened and the water resistant seal wasn't sealed correctly - you may lose the water resistant rating that these phones should have. There's a small chance of that happening, but it could still happen. Good thing - you have an extended 90 day return policy when it comes to Amazon refurbished returns.

If Amazon offered unlocked, new phones - I would go that route - unfortunately they don't.",Neutral,
83,"I received the purple iPhone 11 in perfect shape! No scratches or cracks, it�s beautiful! Upgraded from the iPhone 7 Plus and this has been a wonderful transition. Easy to transfer info from iPhone to iPhone, too. Quick shipping, received a day early! Would not hesitate to buy used from them again!!",Positive,
84,"Phone doesn�t work on the providers they say it will. I really wish I�d paid attention to the 1-star ratings before I bought it.

Pros: the phone is in great condition and it works well

Cons: It�s not really unlocked � or its some weird hardware configuration. It won�t connect to the providers they said it would. I was on a Verizon network and bought the phone so I could switch to sprint. It didn�t work on sprint. I contacted the seller�s support, and they gave me lots of things to try. I tried them long enough for the return window to pass. Then they basically said, too bad for me.

If I had it to do again, I�d spend a little more and get something that works properly. Or just returned the phone and got another.",Negative,
85,It�s in perfect condition. Arrived with charging cable. No earphones but the description said it didn�t include them. Great purchase and currently using it to write this review.,Positive,
86,"Phone was in great condition except the screen. Screen has noticeable damage and deep scratches. Wasn�t included in description, and def not worth the full price of phone. Overall I rather not send it back so I guess I�m dealing w it.",Positive,
87,it seemed like new the thing I didn�t like is was it wasn�t in its original boxing didn�t even last three months and the screen started bugging out since it�s refurbished and the seller won�t help me by swapping it or giving you a refund. I�m mad and upset 700$ for a busted iPhone 11 what a rip off:( don�t buy this product as it�s just a broken phone. Better off buying a new one. They won�t even swap or anything. Like I just want a full refund n to send it back:( very unpleasant,Negative,
88,"Excellent shape, looks brand new and battery health is at 100%. Came perfectly padded with charging cord and wall charger. This was a great buy, doesn�t seem �renewed� at all, appears new.",Positive,
89,"I had to send my first phone back as there was a scratched area on the screen about the size of a quarter. Called Amazon and got replacement ordered right away no problem with Amazon Renewed guarantee.

Second iPhone comes and literally the same scratched area on this one too. If I didn�t know better, I would have thought they were the same phone based on the scratched area. I decided to put on a screen protector and see if that minimized the scratches, which it did.

I believe the scratches are part of the refurb process or something, but would really have preferred the seller to have done better QC. I didn�t want to send back another time so I kept the phone. Because of that, I give 3 stars. Good price and responsive seller and Amazon was good to work with, but my wife�s phone from another seller didn�t have the screen scratch issue I did.

Battery life seems good and no other issues with the phone. I feel like a scratched screen is kinda a big deal though since the screen is the phone basically. It also wasn�t a scuff as I could ever so slightly catch a finger nail on it and I tried to rub it off.",Positive,
90,It was my first time buying a phone online. I upgraded from the iphone 7. This product came exactly as advertised and works really well. I was a little skeptical buying it but it works great and i have no problems. The shipping was quick too.,Positive,
91,The phone came i excellent condition looked like it was new 100% battery works great,Positive,
92,"I was very excited and looking forward to receive my new iPhone, but now I�m feeling I should�ve paid the extra $50 to buy a new iPhone from Apple directly. At first glance the phone looks great! Came with a screen protector with no noticeable scratches/damages to the phone physically. When setting up my phone one of the first things I noticed was how loud the sound was, sound quality was off too. I had my audio low and on mute and notification rings were still loud. Then I got my first phone call and that�s I become disappointed. It was difficult to hear and understand the other person the phone, I had to switch to speaker to listen. It sounds staticky like if it weren�t plugged in correctly or if speakers were in the wrong place. I�m afraid to go to the Apple store to get the battery replaced (since the battery arrived at 88% health). I�ve only been playing with phone for 6 hours now and have found questionable thing like the audio issue that have disappointed me in my purchase...",Neutral,
93,"I requested an exchange because the phone I got reset on me a few times while trying to set it up. Like I had to redo adding my wifi and password, all the settings like country, prompts, etc. They made the return process so easy so I�ll give them props for that! Just got the �exchange� item. IT�S THE SAME EXACT PHONE I SENT BACK! I know because I recognize the small set of scuffs in the top right hand corner. They asked if I wanted the same color and I specified if it was available or I�d even take a white if it was a better option. They just replaced the little back sticker that came off when I had to clean it the first time I received it because it arrived dirty( like how phones get when they�ve been on a case for a while and the random dust/gunk that kind of accumulates) and added a fancy gold charging cord instead of the play white one. For paying over $400 for a renewed phone like this one I�d say OVERPRICED. They should base their prices off of how the phone looks and not just charge the same for all phones. I can say I�m disappointed to say the very least. The battery life is 86%. The renewed iPhone 8plus I ordered 2 years ago (from somewhere similar) came at 97% battery life. That�s why I had high hopes it would be fine to order renewed.

Will not order from again when the time comes to get a different phone. I�ve learned my lesson.",Negative,
94,Speakers are blown and very crackly. Cannot hear it is so bad.,Negative,
95,I ordered this phone for over $500 on here. It�s supposed to be a renewed fully unlocked phone. Upon receiving the phone I noticed pits and scratches on back of phone which was a no biggie since I have a case for it. But upon installing my SIM card from my existing boost iPhone into this phone and it wouldn�t work. It just said no service on top corner of phone. I then went to Boost website to try to activate it and then I noticed that they had the same phone for $449. So decided to send this back and order from boost and I know o won�t have any issues when I transfer my SIM card from my existing phone.,Neutral,
96,I was a little scared to buy a phone off line and was really excited when it came in the mail earlier than expected. But sad to say that the left side of the touch screen doesn�t work most of the time and will have to return. Very disappointed in my purchase,Neutral,
97,"What an awful, frustrating month long experience. Save yourself a ton of grief and aggravation and do not buy a phone here!! This whole experience was tragic. The phone was an absolute complete and total piece of worthless junk. The key board didn't work, it constantly froze up, it muted itself whenever it felt like it. I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned! Don't waste your time with this company. they sell you junk and make it as hard as possible to return for a refund. one month out and I still don't have a phone. Waiting till Black Friday at this point and buying new.",Negative,
98,I waa skeptical about getting this iPhone because it was a renewed product and it was via Amazon not an iPhone dealer. My kid had received a couple of hundred dollars in Amazon gift cards and some cash for her birthday. I wanted her to have a new phone but I didn't want to be under a contract so purchasing was the best bet. I read the reviews and read up on the Amazon Renewed program and it seemed like a good deal. The gift cards helped defray the cost. She got what she wanted in perfect condition. I purchased the warranty for extra protection and we took it to Metro PCS by T-Mobile and they set it up without a hitch. I will use the Renewed program again. I saved about $100 over the cost of a new phone and was able to purchase a case and shield with change to spare.,Positive,
99,I was quite skeptical about buying an iPhone from here but when mine came in the mail those suspicions left. Mine came basically new with only a few tiny scratches. 100% battery life and everything worked perfectly! Totally worth it tbh,Positive,
100,"This phone is practically new. Absolutely no signs of use but a tiny scuff beside the flash on the back of the phone which doesn't hurt the usability and is barely noticeable. The battery is at 100% capacity. Packaged in generic box with a generic charger. When received, there was already a screen protector on the phone. Was able to set up with my carrier immediately. I use straight talk, all I had to do was transfer my information from my current iPhone to this one and move the SIM card from current phone to this one. The process took 10 min at most.",Positive,
101,I purchased the phone but when I took it to T-Mobil the device wouldn�t allow them to activate it. T-Mobil spoke with the customer care person from the seller but they couldn�t get it to work. So they told me to send it back. Prr rt onlem is now they don�t have anymore � at least not at that price. When asked what they can go for me they said nothing. After they receive the device they will credit me.I ended up buying a NEW one unopened and unused by T-Mobil for $599. Yeah it was $113 more but it is unused AND THIS TIME IT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!! They should at least guarantee me another one at that price or at the very least do something for my troubles. The customer care person was nice and polite. But reiterated that there was nothing he can do and this happens. Unfortunately I wouldn�t recommend this company. But new or from Amazon�s renew store. They at least stand by there products and guarantee satisfaction.,Negative,
102,"I purchased this iPhone 11 that said it was unlocked . When I searched for iphone 11a I put Boost mobile only to find out this phone isn�t compatible to boost mobile and I�m really upset and pissed because I spent almost $800 on this phone plus shipping and handling only to find out the phone isn�t even compatible with Boost. I will be getting a refund , credit or somethingI purchased this iPhone 11 that said it was unlocked .

I will be getting a refund , credit or something",Negative,
103,"EXTREEMLY DISSAPOINTED!!!! Waste of time and money!!! This phone is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH T-MOBILE OR SPRINT which is what I have!!!!!! BEWARE BUYERS!! - will update if seller fixes this issue. UPDATE: customer service contacted me but Inspite of me saying 3 times I want to return it please send me a label they kept wasting time asking me how I want to proceed after already telling them!! Emails seemed to just go in circles instead of saying ok sorry here is a label. Now of course they aren�t open on weekends so I am out $700 and a phone even longer now! Not appreciating this at all. Not happy right now, hope they rectify this and they send me the label ASAP because this is NOT OK.",Negative,
104,"So i'm going to be completely honest, i was extremely worried about spending the amount of money i did on amazon. But with that being said the phone arrived extremely fast, and is in close to Brand new condition with the exception of a tiny nick on the bottom right corner of the phone, which is no biggie at all. I have had the phone for about a month now and it has been ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! no problems as of now and highly doubt there will be any... fingers crossed. side note It does not come in the original box or at least mine didn't which for me personally is not a problem, just wanted to give a heads up. Highly recommend, Good luck!",Positive,
105,I was a little skeptical about buying an iPhone off of amazon but I�m super happy with this phone it was brand new and came with a full battery. It was very easy to set up...and it is fully unlocked so you can get any type of phone carrier you want. Definitely would recommend people to buy.,Positive,
106,Was skeptical as well. Although it came faster than expected and was perfect it felt like a new phone from Apple expect for obvious reasons. Nothing is different about this phone expect for where you are getting it from. Mines came fully unlocked working no scratches or cracks.. Stellar phone In general,Positive,
107,"I brought three(3) of the phone for my family and they work okay for a month. After that month of use it become disaster because they all came down with a battery problem. The phone would literally shut down while I'm on important calls, it was extremely hot and the battery wasn't holding the charge. I personally replaced the battery with the original batteries and same thing occur. The reason I couldn't return was because I was out of the country and wouldn't be able to return in time.",Negative,
108,Perfect phone. Looks like new. Unlocked. No scratches at all. It looks like I just got it on an apple store. Ty. I am VERY HAPPY with my phone,Positive,
109,Ordered this phone because it said it worked for TMOBILE. It doesn't work with TMobile and it isn't unlocked. It is carrier locked to a different company and cannot be unlocked through TMobile. According to TMOBILE it can only be unlocked through the original carrier and they don't know who that is. Big waste of time and money! I've asked for a refund but this is just more days of waiting to be able to buy a phone. Writing this review so others can be cautious.,Negative,
110,"I love ittttt! I was a little skeptical at first, but I love this phone! It came with a charger, and it came in a day early!",Positive,
111,I Love This Phone To Be a Renewed Phone It's Awesome. For Almost $700 it's A Great Buy.,Positive,
112,"My phone was delivered before the promised date, well packaged and just what I ordered. I have since set it up and it is running magnificently. I absolutely am so delighted with my phone",Positive,
113,"the phone worked well, but the face recognition did not work. I tried everything, but nothing and I had to send my phone to amazon to get my money back and I was left without phone for a couple of days.",Negative,
114,Good,Positive,
115,"Hi everyone. This phone is the biggest amazon purchase I've made and I don't regret it! I was hesitant at first after reading some horrible reviews about other phones online, but this hasn't disappointed me yet. The phone arrived in excellent condition- like brand new. Ive had it almost 2 weeks now and I've had ZERO issues. I bought a separate case and screen protector - I've dropped it several times already (i'm clumsy) and it still held up great. No issues with the touch screen. The battery life is amazing!!!! If you have doubts, I hope my review helps you seal the deal :)",Positive,
116,Absolutely amazing and so glad I made this decision! Definitely worth every penny,Positive,
117,Phone came in amazing shape. It didn�t come in it�s original Apple box which is fine and it didn�t come with the original apple charger which is also okay! It still came with a nice lengthy charger regardless. The phone has 100% battery capacity and it had absolutely no dents or scratches on it.,Positive,
118,"So I was very skeptical only because this would be my second purchase through amazon . The first time was ordering for my mother in law and it turned out fine for her , physically flawless phone with great battery life. For me on the other hand the battery life was disappointing and I feel like the speakers are bit off like it was renewed from water damage possibly. Also the phone wasn�t all the way unlocked . Though I can use it fine and my SIM card works , for some reason it won�t fully register with my provider online and when I chatted with an agent through Verizon they said my phone was non-Verizon device and they were unable to unlock it which again begs the question is it truly unlocked? Or was there a loophole and I can still use it properly with no problem. Will be returning only because the storage is not enough in comparison to my old phone but I�ve read that it�s a hit or miss when returning these phone so wish me luck !",Neutral,
119,"The screen on the left side was sometimes not recognizing my touch, which leads me to look closely at the device and it looks like it's a damaged piece that was repaired. The device was warded off, looked to be overused, Camera has scratches and frame dents, mute knob some times does not mute the piece.
There are better-refurbished devices for the same price, this one looks to be totally repaired.",Negative,
120,"My first Apple product since the ipod. Which still works BTW. I suffered through a whole series of android phones. Had issues with them. Calls dropped, bad reception. Calls I was waiting for going directly to voicemail. I blamed my carrier and I was wrong. It was the phones.

Easy to use. Better texting/fast fewer mistakes. More intuitive. So simple to pair accessories. Just works effortlessly. I have excellent reception and the phone works all the time. It is reliable and it seems sturdy, not cheap. I am now an Apple person. My next computer will be Apple too. I am done fighting with technology. I want it to work for me and Apple does that.",Positive,
121,"I was very skeptical about buying a renewed iphone. The phone arrived like a brand new iPhone, not a single dent or scratch and it has been working perfectly",Positive,
122,Quick safely-packaged delivery. A little disappointed in myself for not doing my own research on price/value because they have this exact phone brand new on the Apple website for about $50 more than I paid for a renewed version of I understood correctly but hey ya live and ya learn. I really like this phone. Easy to set up me as I already have an IPhone 7 Plus. It is not as large or as heavy as the 7 Plus which is a great thing for me because I have some arthritis in my hands. Nice crisp screen/view and not as harsh on the eyes for some reason. I LOVE the green color!! Might try trading in my old phone towards another Apple doodad. We shall see. Smoothe easy deal. YAY!!!,Positive,
123,"Phone came with a screen protector on it that had a scratch on it...or seemed to. Screen protector cracked so I removed it and there�s not only one huge gouge but another one and a scuff mark on the screen. Touch screen doesn�t always work the best either. As soon as I get a replacement, I will be sending it back :(",Negative,
124,I love this so much ! The vendor was one of the only ones who had yellow iPhones available at a good price. I just upgraded from a iPhone 8 that I had for less then a week due to it size. Now this is everything I wanted and more. I love yellow lol. Also I was so happy to see there was a screen protector already in my phone. Like really? That�s a win. I now have 4 extras just in case . It�s also a lot faster then my iPhone 8 and transferring my stuff was eAsy.,Positive,
125,Good phone for the price,Positive,
126,Absolutely wonderful product. Bought refurbished from Amazon warehouse. Looks and performs as brand new. Fantastic. The product arrived one day earlier than promised.,Positive,
127,I was pretty worried about getting a refurbished phone off of amazon but this is definitely worth the buy! It doesn�t come in the Apple box or has earphones but the phone is in amazing condition! It looks brand new and has full battery capacity but also it comes with A tempered glass screen protector on the phone!,Positive,
128,The phone came without a scratch. Easy to set up. Everything works.,Positive,
129,"Plus the BUY BACK Program is a scam. They try to low ball you, AFTER saying the expected amount they'll give you AFTER you've already sent it in. Then if you don't accept you get it back weeks later. Plus I sent it in with a brand new ""Real Apple Charge Cable & Charger"" and they KEPT the cable and charger, only returned the phone. The phone I traded in, was in better screen shape than the screen on the phone I purchased. Will NEVER do this again.",Negative,
130,"I�m so thankful Amazon offers the phone refurbished. I�m not spending $150 a month with leases and payments to these phone companies. With a family of seven and kids that want to keep up with the Joneses. Verizon offers a prepaid plan unlimited everything for $35. That�s right for $35 a month draft it out of your debit card or go in the store and pay. If you have your own phone you get the same service as I paid $150 a month for for $35. I cannot do that if Amazon did not offer these refurbished phones. Thanks to Amazon and thanks to whoever is refurbishing these phones. Please take my advice,Switch to prepaid and buy yourself a pair of shoes every month with the savings",Positive,
131,"So far so good, I have only had the phone a few days, the delivery process went smoothly. The phone did look fairly new the only give away was that it did not come in the apple box and I did not receive an original apple charger to use with it, but I purchased my own. For the price I feel like I did get a good deal, definitely better than paying over a thousand just for the original box and charger and earbuds, I believe that is all I�m missing. The phone did appear unlocked, I use AT&T and it works fine with it.",Positive,
132,"Wow... Went to activate phone and Verizon says the phone has been reported as STOLEN?!?!? The girl at tech support was very nice and issued me a refund. She stated that the phone may not have been wiped clean by the previous owner, but either way, aren�t they supposed to check these things out before simply sending them out to buyers? Wow, I�d expect this on eBay, but not Amazon.",Negative,
133,"If there is ever a phone I was ever so pleased with, it�s this one. I got it during quarantine time because I had accidentally put my old phone in the washer. Anyway, this phone is excellent for a refurbished. From face recognition, battery life span, camera quality, storage, I wouldn�t ask for a better phone. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to but iPhone 11 for an affordable price, one year now and my phone is still intact. Bought another one for my brother and he was not disappointed. I also got them in their apple packaging with accessories which is unbelievable because I thought I wouldn�t by the comments. 10 stars, get you this phone.",Positive,
134,Honestly it was because of the reviews why I trusted the seller. And it was worth it. Can�t complain no scratches no damage no issues what so ever. I wild recommend anyone to them. I use metro pcs as my carrier and they do support this phone. Plus I get to keep my bill low. Win win.,Positive,
135,"Excellent condition, like new. Very happy with it so far.",Positive,
136,"I love it so much!! Definitely an upgrade for sure i had the iPhone 8 previously ! It was about $100 cheaper than the apple website!! A few people mentioned in there reviews that they received a screen protector with there phone but i did not, it did come with a charger, the block for it!! I am very satisfied I didn�t have to call my phone company either to have the phones/ sim card switched it did that all its self which i love, it made the process so much easier!! I did go ahead an buy a case & protector & that was the part that got me most i could buy phone case & protector along with the phone & it was still under what apple was trying to sell it for! Thank you amazon P.s. no cracks, dents, or scratches that i can see! Also came early!!",Positive,
137,I received the phone two weeks ago and I was a little nervous after some of the reviews I've read about renewed phone. It came in a generic box and the phone was inside a bubble wrap package. I quickly inspected the phone and it was perfect. It looks practically brand new. It also came with free screen. Booted the phone and completed the setup. Phone works great so far! Will keep everyone posted if anything change.,Positive,
138,Very nice It�s not a scam,Positive,
139,"It came defective in certain parts of the screen - it didn't feel the touch. I could not even enter my Apple ID because it didn't catch certain letters from the keyboard, especially the ""o"".
For that reason, I couldn't pass the factory settings to check the cell phone in other aspects such as the camera, the battery, or the speakers.
When I contacted the company, they told me they regret the problem (they only attend Monday to Friday - 9:00 am - 5:00 pm EST). After some e-mails, they asked me to take the cell phone to a repair shop to inquire about a QUOTE of a diagnosis and estimated repair cost.
Finally, they told me that the only thing they could do was give me the refund and not the replacement of the product because ""they don't have it in stock"".",Negative,
140,I purchased the black iPhone 11 and it came in with no scratches or dents in the phone. The screen was also flawless. The battery percent was at 100%. I am satisfied with my purchase and would definitely buy from BuySpry again!! Also this is my second amazon refurbished phone purchase. 10/10 would recommend,Positive,
141,This phone came in only two days. The phone came with a sturdy charger and charging box. The phone also came with a glass screen protector on it which I REALLY appreciate bc I can NEVER get mine on perfectly. This one is on PERFECTLY. the battery life was at 100%. In perfect condition. Even came w ab 80% battery.,Positive,
142,"The phone is very nice looking and it was so easy to set up the phone. It took no time to set up phone and for all my stuff to show back up on here. I suggest that if u have a phone u should do the trade in option like i did because you can get money off the phone. Only problem I had is thatthe phone wasn�t updated and I had to wait an hour to update the phone. But other than that overall nice phone! The seller was super nice btw and very helpful :) I will do a one month update on this phone so watch out for that. (I�ve had it for a week now)

Update :

Phone really isn�t unlocked to all carriers but overall the phone is ok ig. It�s it works only with cdma networks Not happy",Negative,
143,"My phone operated terribly. The time and date were never correct on my phone, the notifications didn�t work, the sound was crackly so any time i would listen to music or anything it would crackle. speaker phone didn�t work, the front flash was completely foggy there were dents and chips in the phone itself when it arrived. I tried various methods to fix these things and i contacted the seller and all they said was to return the phone. they did not say they�d exchange it or they�d fix my phone and we�re not helpful at all. i returned the phone and just bought one from apple it was only 30$ more.",Negative,
144,Mine came with a dead pixel and 90 percent battery life. I returned it and just bought a new one. While you might get lucky and get a like new product it just isn�t worth it to me to save 50 dollars. They need to lower their price to around 100 less then new to make me ever think about buying a used phone again.,Negative,
145,Came in time was wrapped very good It is a great phone Im enjoying it very much,Positive,
146, I always buy used phones but the last phone I bought battery was messed up (it�s was a iPhone 6s) and desperately needed a new phone I came across this phone on here and was Skeptical because not a lot of people left reviews but the reviews that were left were good there was only two bad reviews so I decided to buy it I bought This phone in purple With 128 GB unlocked it came 3 days earlier than expected it came with a charger and a charging box didn�t come in in the original box or with the earbuds but I didn�t expect it to come with that anyways the phone its self is in great quality there are no cracks no chips nothing Iv been using the phone for 3 days now and haven�t had any problems the Face ID is fast and working everything about the phone is fast Nd the battery life is amazing the camera is so HD and the speaker is loud all around the best phone. of course not everyone will get the same phone sum might come with cracks sum might not but I would recommend to buy and try it if it don�t work just send it back but this is wroth it I plan on buying another one for my sister,Positive,
147,"After a three year hiatus of wanting another phone from the iPhone 6plus which by the way was a replacement from my 8plus at the time � yea I know you all like what the � lol yes times was hard lol came across this phone read the reviews and since I�ve purchased online in the past I�m like why not shipping was like less then 48 hrs! Phone arrived without original packaging but they did a great job package that once it get to you it�s in a safe condition! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PHONE!!! Battery life greAt! The speaker sound is Amazing! But the Camera�s!!!!!!! Take the cake all the way home! I feel like a real
Photographer! Lol I be ready to go to nature trails etc! This is definitely a GREAT BUY for an FANTASTIC price!!! 
One person found this helpful",Positive,
148,"So far I�m very pleased with the iPhone 11 I received. I purchased an AT&T locked phone because it was cheaper and I�ve had so many bad experiencing buying �unlocked� phones in the past that aren�t unlocked.

Anyway, I�m upgrading from an old iPhone 6s so by comparison everything seems super sleek and nice. My refurbished phone came to me undamaged and I did not find any nicks or scratches on it, it essentially looks brand new. Battery life seems amazing. The seller even put a screen protector on it, which was a super nice touch and I was not expecting it.",Positive,
149,"i was a little weary about buying an iphone from a third party seller, but this phone is amazing quality! it came with an apple charger, and there were absolutely no scratches or damage on the phone. it works like new and the maximum battery capacity was at 100%. it�s super fast and the camera quality is amazing. for about 300 dollars less, it�s an amazing deal",Positive,
150,"Great product so far I�ve been waiting some time to write this review because people say it breaks after a week to a month it�s been a little over a week and it�s been great looks brand new no issues whatsoever I�ll keep you updated however.

Continued: about a month later idk I�ve been having connectivity issues. It isn�t that big of a deal but it�s too much of a hassle to be sent a new phone so I make do but I�ll probably end up getting a new one.",Positive,
151,"It�s perfect <3 My date got me this phone as a v times day gift and I just absolutely love it there�s no problems at all (not a paid review lol :,> ) there are a few scratches on the side but it�s nothing a phone case can�t fix the back and front came with no scratches for me but for everyone it may be different there are absolutely NO issues with the phone easy to get in adding you Apple ID and everything it�s just a overall good phone! So if your having second thoughts about ordering this Don�t it�s indeed the real deal :> ok I�m done now follow me on Instagram and tik tok tho and if you need more information on this feel free to contact me @Jxstsalt on Instagram and tik tok <3",Positive,
152,The phone should be water proof but after putting the phone in water it shut off. Extremely disappointed.,Negative,
153,This is a great product!! The phone came in a good reliable box and was here a day before it was supposed to be. I would recommend this seller 100%,Positive,
154,"Ok, let me start by saying I was really sketched out by ordering this. It still costs a pretty penny but you�re unable to view the quality before hand. This by no means will receive a 5 star rating from me not because it lacks the apple packaging and accessories but because it had minor scratching on the screen. Everything Else so far has been perfect but don�t expect to get a flawless phone. a simple screen cover helped the scratch look but that�s not the point. The screens for the iPhone 11 are not oled so they are inexpensive to replace. There is no reason why based on this price tag that they couldn�t have replaced the scratch screen as well. Overall , happy with the purchase but not blown away",Neutral,
155,"UPDATE: return and refund went smoothly. New phone works perfectly, no issues!

According to Apple this is a faulty device that needs to be replaced. It randomly powers down and they say it's a logic board problem that cannot be fixed. I'm hoping the seller will contact me ASAP to exchange the phone for a product that is not damaged. If so I will update my review to reflect that. This was my Mothers' Day gift. Kind of sucks that it's broken.",Positive,
156,"Eh. In my opinion, it�s just as expensive as a brand new phone but it appears gently used. T-Mobile full price was 599.. this phone (shipping + cost+taxes) was 592.. It came with a non brand charger, it�s got minor scratches on the screen and some around the border. Battery is alright. Fortunately, nothing major. It shipped next day for me so that was good. I�m still debating sending it back but set up takes a while so you contemplate keeping it. I was a little worried about security but it seems alright...",Neutral,
157,"I bought this phone a few months ago and wanted to wait before writing a review. Overall, I am very happy with it. No glitches or bugs, minimal scratches on the back. I recommend this seller.",Positive,
158,Brand new phone. Great quality for the best price. Very happy with it and would recommend. I wish it came with earbuds though.,Positive,
159,"This was a purchase for my teenage son. He has had this phone now for about three months and loves everything about it. The camera has so many features, it�s truly incredible. The lightning fast charge really works. I wouldn�t be afraid to by renewed from Amazon. This is a great quality phone.",Positive,
160,"Almost like new! It had a couple light scratches in the back and a bit deeper one on the bottom side (not the screen but on the gold/black part) it isn�t anything to be upset about since it�ll be covered by a case and isn�t that visible unless you look for it.

The phone heats up a little bit sometimes but I�ve noticed it�s when I�m holding my phone more by the middle. Works great! Make sure to update the software or the apps won�t load",Positive,
161,"( 62 days old) bright light on bottom pages disappears, phone freezes, s amazon told seller to send another one. Been waiting 3 months seller keeps on refusing. Amazon promised me that they will talk to him and I will get another one. Called 4 times since April. I would never buy from this seller again. Only amazon direct where they have control Also the phone gets very very hot and can not hold a charge for long time battery wears down fast",Negative,
162,I love it.,Positive,
163,"Phone works great and it arrived early with super fast shipping! I was kinda bummed it came with only 89% battery life-I�m jealous of the people who got the 100% battery-but seriously-this is a great deal; my carrier tried to sell me the same phone for almost $1,200 with a contact. The one downside to the iPhone 11 (to me anyway) is that there is no headphone jack. Love the facial recognition-wait� there�s a fingerprint reader?! I had no idea.",Positive,
164,"I bought this phone the first time over a month ago. When I unboxed it, the keyboard did not work and I couldn't even get past setup. On the second phone, the screen flickered every time I pressed a button. The only good thing I can say is that the return process was easy. These are not ""certified"". They have been checked for physical damage and that is all.",Negative,
165,"I haven�t owned an iPhone since the first generation. I�ve been an android baby for years since then. That said, they�ve made iPhone controls way easier to learn and handle since then. I was a bit skeptical to swap over, but it�s definitely worth dropping Android for the smooth experience.

This vendor shipped the phone in perfect condition, no scratches, battery life was perfect. It also arrived close to 2 days earlier than the original estimate. Very pleased with this purchase, when the time comes to grab a new phone for my wife, I know exactly where to order from.",Positive,
166,"I�m overall happy. I haven�t had it for a month yet, but when receiving it, the battery was at 92% health, which is still good, for what I need. The customer service was quick to get back regarding a question I had in date of purchase. I�m not able to get Applecare since the date of purchase is not updated, but I don�t need phone insurance.

There weren�t any scratches or knicks. I ordered, used like new. There isn�t any lag when using the phone. No glitches. I did have a hard time updating the phone at first. I had to start over (transferring content from my old phone) , but once I did that, and got back to the update portion, everything went smoothly. I thought I had a lemon, but it is indeed exactly what I need. For $589, used-like new, and refurbished, this is what I hoped for.",Positive,
167,Just got my phone today and got it activated with cricket and it works perfectly the only thing is right now there is a small black shadow at the bottom of my screen that just started if in the next couple days it won't go away I will send it back but other than that I LOVE IT!!!,Positive,
168,At first I was a little bit skeptical about buying this phone from a random seller but I still proceeded to purchase the phone. I'm so glad I did because the phone came in PERFECT condition. No scratches or cracks anywhere along the phone. It even came with a screen protector on the phone and even one for the back camera.,Positive,
169,Phone works great! Works with my straight talk plan. Battery life is wonderful! Super fast shipping!,Positive,
170,"We had an issue with calls hearing them, during the 90 day period and they were awesome in getting a replacement next day after me shipping the defective one back. They respond to messages immediately and are very nice to work with! Other than that one little issue there was nothing wrong with the phone at all in perfect condition. If I order refurbished again I will definitely be going through them",Positive,
171,"After having this iphone 11 for just 3 days, I've come to realize that there are issues with the phone that were not addressed before it was sent to me. After fully resetting and updating the phone, checking the sim card with my service provider, and even taking it to multiple phone repair shops to have it checked... The phone still completely restarts without any warning up to 10 times in an hour. The device also seems to have some screen sensitivity issues and sometimes it will not respond to touch for several moments before working. On top of that, this phone hasn't been able to locate any of the bluetooth devices in my home that other members of the household are easily able to connect to.
I honestly don't know what went wrong here considering all the other good reviews, but let's just say you're definitely taking a chance if you buy a refurbished phone. I guess I'm going to have to send this one in for a refund... an unfortunate waste of time.",Negative,
172,"This phone is supposed to have no scratches visible at arms length. Not true. Very very visible scratches. However it is a good phone and a glass screen protector will cover them. Was a bit disappointed to see such visible scratches, but it was at a discount. I guess you get what you pay for.",Positive,
173,"Before buying I specifically selected ""unlocked"" when prompted to select a carrier. After hours of trying to activate and switch over my service, I spent another hour on the phone with my provider only to find out that the phone was locked. Then to make matter worse the phone would not allow me to log into the app store, or transfer my data over. I'll most likely return the phone because I am so angry about everything that I just went through. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's a hassle and a half and you're most likely going to have to return it too.",Negative,
174,Buyer beware... be very careful buying these refurbished phones. I received mine which was supposed to be able to be used on T-Mobile's network. I took it into the store to link it to my plan and was informed that it could not be used because it is currently registered to another user. So it either was not wiped clean or was stolen. Returned and received a refund.,Negative,
175,"I bought this phone for $700 a couple of months after Apple released the iPhone 11. This phone worked right for maybe 4-5 months. Now every 30 minutes it disables because the temperature is too hot. My phone loses connection every 30 minutes no matter how important I am in need of my phone to make calls, it loses service. I have service with straight talk. I have for years, as soon as I put this phone on their Phone service, it automatically started to give me problems. Straight talk has never led me to have issues but if you buy a phone from Electronic Deals from Amazon you'll definitely wind up with a whole lot of problems and wasted money.",Negative,
176,"Purchased this only to have the speaker go out in 4 months ( fitting since the seller ""warranty"" window is 3 months). Took it to best buy and they wouldn't work on it because it is an international version. Now I have to either pay $600 to fix a non-us version or but a new one. I knew 8 was taking a chance on a ""renewed"" device, but this is ridiculous. Worst decision ever buying this one.
Word of advice, when buying a phone, verify with the serial number that it is in fact the correct version.",Negative,
177,"The phone itself is nice, there are a few tiny scratches on the corner but they're not noticeable at all. I've had it for about a week and everything works fine, the battery health is at 90% and lasts for awhile between charges which is nice. I took off a couple stars because of shipping issues; for some reason my phone was unable to be delivered the 1st time and was returned to the shipper, so I had to contact the seller to send me a new one. This whole process took about 3 weeks which was super annoying, and the seller never explained why the first phone had to be sent back. Overall I would recommend buying this phone but avoiding this seller.",Neutral,
178,This is my second time buying an Iphone from Amazon sellers. The first phone I bought was a Iphone 6 in 2017 and up to today it lasted me with no problems but I needed a new upgraded phone with a better c�mara and all new features. I decided to try this seller and purchased my Iphone 11 which didn't come in the original box but who cares the phone is working perfectly fine for the price I paid it is worth it. Really happy with it. Thank you.,Positive,
179, The phone keeps on turning off and on over and over on its own when I open an app it keeps turning off and on over and over. Not worth buying. Returning the phone,Negative,
180,I have to say I was skeptical when purchasing this phone but I absolutely love it. It came with a screen protector already applied as well as a charger. It has no scratches to the screen or any other part of the phone also battery was at 100%. Absolutely love this phone. Thank you,Positive,
181,"I LOVE MY IPHONE 11!!! I bought my iphone 11 from here and i was a bit nervous, i�ve never purchased a phone outside of a phone store so i had my concerns. I read many many reviews on amazon and found this to be the best reviews. I am not disappointed! My screen is not cracked/not scratched, battery life is good, the camera is astounding and I adore the color! I highly recommend purchasing your phone from here. The only hang up I had was getting it set up with verizon, phone issues are never simple however so i kind of expected that. The customer service struggled with switching over my account to another account though, so that has nothing to do with the phone itself. Phone works great on verizon service!",Positive,
182,"Aveces tiene un pequeno descontrol con el volumen pero despues de ahi esta perfecto, me encanta, es mi herramienta mas importante de trabajo desde casa.

La carga dura mucho, no es necesario cargarlo todos los dias, con cada 2 dias esta perfecto y le doy mucho uso.",Positive,
183,"Haven�t noticed anything wrong with phone in 3 months so far, battery seems brand new and camera looks good. A lot of space for cheap too. Mine started by charging really slow but I wouldn�t worry about that because the phone was probably powered off for awhile. Also I would buy a better charger this comes with a generic charger and with no phone box.",Positive,
184,I was a little concerned to buy a phone off the internet from a 3rd party�but my good friend recommended it. i bought it for my husband and he loves it!! It�s perfect and cheaper to buy it this way with a credit card than to get one from a phone store! I definitely recommend!,Positive,
185,"Brand new phone, are at least it was supposed to be. The screen came scratched! The company place a screen protector over the top to hide, so sent it out damaged in the first place. Very disappointed in the large purchase and already damaged!!",Negative,
186,"First This phone is not unlocked, so that is a lie, it will no work with Verizon, and then it is shipped with fedex! FedEx is not reliable! The phone was supposed to be here 2 weeks ago, still a not here! Just buy a new phone and save yourself a lot of time. It is not worth the few bucks you save buying this one!",Negative,
187,"The phone delivery faster than a day that Amazon estimate. The battery life is 100% very good. But the phone is very dirty in the back, especially in the camera part. And the memory has been used 11GB for something that I do not know. I do not see any headphones here but it is all right no big problem. The fully unlock that I pick for the phone is working well with the T-Mobile sim card. The charge that Amazon provides charge phone really slow to get to 100% but I already have a wireless charger so no big issue with that. All of the things that I list above about the product that I buy make me feel happy because this is a trusted place to buy the phone. But I think you should buy an iPhone 12, the same price but better color than iPhone 11.",Neutral,
188,"Its my second time I bought a iPhone from amazon renewed and with buyspry partner.

My first time was a iPhone xs, and the cellphone was great, no one visible scratch and screen protector and battery life about 85%

This time I was bought a iPhone 11, and this have 3 visible scratches in the screen and doesnt come with screen protector, but the battery is in 100%.

I am little dissaponited because in the last buy, the cellphone was practically in new condition, this last one I get the impression that is not new and its used unlike the last buy (I know that no one of amazon renewed its new, but it gives the feeling of).",Neutral,
189,I bought the phone refurbished and upon receipt I took it to tmobile to start service and the phone was blacklisted and reported stolen by the owner. I couldn't believe it.,Negative,
190,"After a delay of two weeks of receiving the phone, and after getting it set up at my Verizon store, the battery lasted one month! My Apple store told me it would take 5 days to get a new battery for the phone. I was so exasperated that I would be without a phone for that long I traded it in and bought the 12pro. Never again will I buy a refurbished phone! This really cost me.",Negative,
191,"I was testing the waters to see if I wanted to switch to apple from Android. Phone came in with a few scratches on the body and the battery was at 87%, so it was in pretty good condition. Only returned it because iOS isn't my thing. Comes with a SIM tool and a 10W generic charger. I think the phone is supposed to come with 18W, but it's a good backup charger.",Positive,
192,"The phone I purchased worked very well! The shop was also very accommodating and helpful. If it wasn�t for me going back to Android, I would�ve kept the phone.

I unfortunately was trying iPhone after being with android for 4 years, and I couldn�t do it. It was nice to be able to test the phone with the return guarantee. Also, not sure how they�re replacing batteries, but the battery life was so healthy on the phone. Great work!",Positive,
193,The Best Phone I�ve Ever Owned & I�m Very Satisfied With The Day & Night Quality,Positive,
194,It didn't work out of the box. The number 8 wouldn't work and the downloading of software from the old phone had to be restarted 3 times. Returned it. Bought a 10 refurbished from iPhone. The return was easy so they do stand behind their product and the refund was prompt.,Negative,
195,I gave this a 5/5 because the phone came in perfect shape not even a scratch on it the battery has 100% of it life and came delivered nicely.,Positive,
196,No issues with the phone. It did get here a little late but that was fault of the shipping company,Positive,
197,"Ordered the 11 because I needed a new phone and without a doubt this was the best price for one.
Shipped pretty fast and when it arrived it didn�t come in normal Apple packaging which I expected.
Phone works perfectly but main complaint I had was the battery life wasn�t at 100, not too big of a deal, another complaint was there was a screen protector put on but it was pretty poorly installed doesn�t really effect anything just a little annoying.
Personally I would recommend you to buy this as the phone came in amazing basically new condition and with the price I really can�t complain.",Positive,
198,The product works great and everything but I checked the battery health on the iPhone and it was at 65% battery health. For a iPhone that is supposed to be refurbished they didn't replace the battery. Which means I have to spend more money to get the battery replaced. Not happy that they didn't replace the battery.,Neutral,
199,Love the phone. It did not have a mark or flaw on it. Buy with confidence. Saved a lot of money. My only issue is that it�s not holding a charge. I upgraded from a 6 to an 11. Not one issue switching the phone from one to another. I have Straighttalk service. I am in heaven. Not missing the home button either!,Positive,
200,"Phone was in nice shape except for a few very light scratches on the screen. This is a known issue with the iPhone 11 so I was not surprised. The scratches are insignificant and can't be seen when the phone is being used. They are only visible when the screen is black. Shipping and communication were very good.
Not an iPhone fan bought this for my wife and she likes it.",Positive,
201,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. Purchased a refurbished iPhone 11 and it never connected to cell service correctly until eventually it stopped working altogether. I got a new SIM card and still nothing. Went to apple store and they ran diagnostics on it and found that the phone was faulty. Had to spend $500 to replace the phone. This seller is fraudulent. Do not trust that they will sell you a working product. Buyer beware,Negative,
202,"El producto est� en perfectas condiciones, la vida �til de la bater�a lleg� con un 93%, lleg� en una caja gen�rica pero muy bien empacando.

Llevo us�ndolo casi 2 semanas pero el problema es el siguiente: Me sale un aviso que dice: �Puede que los mensajes de texto necesarios para activar iMessage/FaceTime/iCloud sean de pago� y realmente es muy molesto.

Por favor ay�denme con el error o me ver� obligada a solicitar la devoluci�n del dinero, gracias.",Positive,
203,I love it. Ordered yesterday and it was delivered today which is one day earlier than it was suppose to come. Everything is in perfect condition and it worked with metro. I had 0 issues. Switched from iPhone 8 Plus. I was very hesitant on buying because of some of the reviews saying it wasn�t fully unlocked. but I�m glad I bought it.,Positive,
204,It worked and all but there was a few small scratches on it and I returned it. I had no problems with the return and luckily didn't have to pay to return the phone. Its a beautiful looking phone. I give it 3 stars because it is such a good phone and the return was easy and fair. I just hope they can be more diligent making sure there are no scratches on a phone before they send it.,Neutral,
205,Overall I�m very pleased with my newest purchase from this seller! I upgraded my phone from a 6s to this Unlocked 11. It made a world of difference (clearly lol). Setup and Transfer of my data/photos from my old phone to this one was painless. For those that are using Metro PCS by T Mobile or a similar carrier save yourself some time and frustration and call customer service or login in to your personal account and ACTIVATE your unlocked device to your current account. Will definitely purchase from this seller again.,Positive,
206,"Although it�s a renew phone according what the headline says in the marketplace, I can say it�s a new phone. Beautiful and perfect presentation. This seller has a good service and a fast shipping option, I got my iPhone on time and hope the next one I buy would be under the same conditions both the phone and the shipping",Positive,
207,"This product seems to work fine in the US. Someone told me my phone comes up from Mexico whenI called. Not sure but I think that is the phone because I am using the same service that I have for years. I wish apple had left finger reader on iphone11. The battery life is better then iphone7.
Over all I am happy with this item.",Positive,
208,"I know this is a second hand product but honestly I expected a device without visible scratches held at an arm�s length, as the description says. When I received the phone I immediately saw there was a lot of really noticeable scratches around the bumper. It came with a screen protector which is good, but I removed it to check the screen condition and I also found some scratches, fortunately that's a good way to hide them.
So far the phone is 100% functional I haven't had any trouble, it's fully unlocked as advertised and it came with the battery life at 100% which is perfect!

I bought this phone from BuySPRY and I'm giving this review just 3 stars due to the noticeable scratches. Just for reference I had the opportunity to buy another refurbished iPhone from Chubbiestech in the past and they sent me a mint condition device, unfortunately this seller wasn't available when I bought the iPhone 11 but it is now. Maybe you'll have to pay a little bit more but it's definitely worth it!",Neutral,
209,"I received this item today. I didn't receive retail packaging and I received an off brand charging brick and cord, I great but I could live with it. Went through all the trouble of activating the phone on my service to find out this phone gets hot. I was making my mimoji and the phone started to heat up. This phone had on been on for 15 minutes. I had to send it back.",Negative,
210,Good,Positive,
211,"very visible scratch on screen at top right corner, seller described this junk as like new condition. I thought I am saving $80 dollars by getting a nice like new product but was very disappointed. Packaging was done by a 3-4 years old for sure. whoever think this junk is in new condition need to have their eyes checked. Total waste of time.",Negative,
212,"So far no complaints. However, there's much to learn and no manual included or available from Apple (which I find reprehensible). So, being an iPhone 'newbie' I had to buy a written manual. All I can say is, to use this thing properly , it will require A LOT of further study. It's amazing all the things this phone can do!",Positive,
213,"So far I'm pretty happy with the phone, I definitely prefer it over Android phones. I don't have to use fingerprint reader so that's why the low review on that. Only drawback I can't use my own ringtone/text message tones. My boyfriend tried to and he said it was difficult. I had to read up a little bit on how to use the phone.",Positive,
214,"When arrived, battery life was already at 80%. My husband has had this same phone for two years and he�s still in the 90�s. After researching, I was able to get the same phone for very close to the same price at the Apple store near me and it was brand new. The refund process was fairly easy though.",Negative,
215,"This product claimed that the phone was like new, and it was not at all as advertised. The phone had a very noticeable scratch on the back, which is annoying, but what really got to me is that the camera doesn't work. Whenever I open the camera to use it, the camera keeps attempting (and failing) to adjust. It vibrates the phone profusely and makes it so that I can only use the front facing camera on this phone. Absolutely not worth the price.",Negative,
216,"I got the phone as a gift for my cousin who loves it. Out of the box she was able to get it to work with Metro PCS without issues. Talk, text, internet, she has had no issues. The battery lasts over 3 days without having to recharge (she is a lighter user.) Amazing value for an amazing unit.",Positive,
217,"Value for money
-I love this phone with all my heart even though I just got it like 4 days ago it�s amazing I haven�t had trouble with it AT ALL,it was fully unlocked so the only thing I had to do was transfer my SIM card from my old phone to this phone .There is a minor problem on the front camera when taking pics and vids there�s like a faded red light while take pics ,but nobody really can see it tbh",Positive,
218,"After a month or so the phone is horrible. Turns off all the time randomly. Amazon customer support has been useless as they tell me I have to take the phone to the apple store. I just want to send it back and go to my phone carrier and pay the extra for a phone that ACTUALLY works. I bought two of these and the other one is the exact same issues.

Update: took both phones to apple and they�re both listed as MFG date for the year 1978. Apple said these phones were supposed to be sent back to apple for repairs and never made it and was �re-sold� to me. Returning them as we speak to hopefully get a return",Negative,
219,Ordered a refurbished Iphone 11. It came in excellent condition. Not a scratch on it. It's like new. Everything works great. The seller provided a top quality phone. I'm very pleased and it came in 2 days.,Positive,
220,"Not gonna lie; I was sooooo skeptical about ordering a renewed phone... it took me maybe 4 or 5 days of reading EVERY review, checking ALL ratings and so on and then just basically said screw it we�ll cross that bridge when we get to it.
WELL, let�s just say... the phone was PERFECT!! Not a single scratch, crack, blemish.. like seriously looks like it�s brand new. EVERYTHING works BEAUTIFULLY on this phone including the camera and I am VERY VERY impressed. The ONLY issue I do have is the batter life... it takes FOREVER TO FREAKING CHARGE to where you see green but it�s something I willing to deal with considering I paid a good price and everything about this is damn near brand new",Positive,
221,"Straight out of the box, the phone did not work. The seller told me I just needed to updated the phone. Jumped through hoops trying to update and reset the phone with no success. According to Apple, the phone was over 1500 days out of warranty. Not sure how that is possible since the iPhone 11 was released less than 2 years ago. Do not buy from this seller. It's a scam!!",Negative,
222," Just bought this a few days ago. I really wanted to take car of it so I bought a waterproof case even before I got the phone. So here�s the thing the phone works like new but with just 1 big flaw. Every time someone calls me and I answer the call, the screen just shuts off and I wouldn�t be able to do anything to it for a couple of minutes.it can last for at least 30 minutes. So the trick is I have to be the one to make the call that�s the way to stop it. I guess I can tolerate this but hopefully no more issues comes up.",Neutral,
223,I bought this phone yesterday since I had broken my other phone and needed a new one fast. But since getting it hooked up and working yesterday (the same day I received it) the earpiece is scratchy and distorted to the point that you cant hear the person's words when they talk. Seller so far has not been easy to work with and this is not worth the money.,Negative,
224,"Phone works fine, light wear on the glass but still a great value compared to new. I activated it on AT&T loving it so far. It replaced my 6s so I was due to upgrade. Would recommend 10/10",Positive,
225,Llego pronto.en buenas condiciones,Positive,
226,"El celular vino como nuevo con 100% de bater�a, ya anteriormente hab�a comprado un IPhone XR para m�, este es para mi pareja y vino mucho mejor que el m�o, lo recomiendo completamente o simplemente tuve suerte con ambos, los celulares son desbloqueados ya que son usados en Panama donde vivo.",Positive,
227,"Phone is defective and I�ve contacted the seller several times and have not heard back. The phone won�t stay on and is stuck in a reboot loop. My other phone is broken, hence why I ordered this one and now I have to wait to receive a refund to order another since my phone call and support requests have gone unanswered. I don�t like leaving bad reviews but I�m extremely frustrated and this hasn�t been resolved.",Negative,
228,The iPhone 11 does not allowed to activate the SIM card. We went to our telephone provider and they told us that the SIM is block. I called our telephone provider and technician indicated that this phone is not allowing our SIM card to activate. I do not think this phone is fully unlock to use it. So I am going to return it to the seller and hope they need to fix this issue so that customers are not wasting their time and money.,Negative,
229,"Mine came with a glass screen protector attached, so I think I got a returned phone, but I didn�t mind. There were no scratches on the phone anywhere, so it was basically a free screen protector.

Otherwise, it�s a great phone and this refurbished model works like new.",Positive,
230,Product came in earlier than expected. These iPhones are good as new and I recommend these to anyone looking to purchase an iPhone. I bought 1 for myself and another for my girlfriend and they were both beautiful and in perfect condition. I was also pleased to see that both came with a screen protector installed. I am very satisfied with this product and I suggest this product to anybody looking to get a basically brand new iPhone for a better price.,Positive,
231,"I had been looking everywhere for an unlocked iPhone 11 but they were hard to find. The refurbished price was about $800, unless I wanted to risk eBay. This was such a great deal and the phone works perfectly. It came in 4 days, was packaged carefully, and no problems at all.",Positive,
232,"Cons: degraded batter life (not renewed or refurbished)
Pros: cosmetically perfect, in working condition, screen protector. The only factors saving it from a much harsher review.",Positive,
233,"Value for the money, it had a couple of scratches in the back but barely noticeable otherwise the phone runs good fully unlocked looks almost like new . The only complain I have about this phone is that the charger that comes with it, is not an Apple charger is just those cheap chargers you could buy at the dollar store. it does charge with it, but be ready to buy a new one soon after",Positive,
234,"Acceptable performance for the price. Heavy and clunky compared to the Pixel 3a I was using before this iPhone 11, plus the camera isn't any better than what I had with my $250 Pixel -- both shoot decent wide angle photos and video, decent processing capabilities, and both have crappy digital zoom functionality. Mostly got this for the better integration with hearing aids.",Positive,
235,"It�s not bad for a refurbished phone however, I would call this grade B refurbished. Most refurbished items I buy come from Walmart and I never have a problem. They always seem to be in perfect condition. It did come with a tempered glass which was a plus but when I went to put it on I immediately noticed lots of scratches on the screen. I�m assuming the screen was never replaced. The battery life is at 90% which means they don�t replace the batteries either. I�m a little disappointed with my experience because I�ve never had this happen before. I recommend if you are wanting something more �new� like because this is DEFINITELY in used condition.",Positive,
236,"Looked like a brand new phone, no marks, smudges or scratches to be found. Came with aftermarket USB charger and lightening cable. Was cleared to be freshly set up. I verified IMEI with Apple. And had no problem porting my phone number to it from ATT to T-mobile.",Positive,
237,"I couldn�t have made a wiser decision about this iPhone 11. First off, it�s almost $60 cheaper than a brand new one, which is practically a steal. Then, it arrives 3 days early, who doesn�t love that? Lastly, I have boost mobile as a phone provider, so purchasing the phone totally unlocked was the way to go, walking into the store and getting the phone activated with the plan I already have took about 10 minutes, all I needed was a SIM card to be put in, which is $10.
To anyone worrying about buying this and it being a bust, fear not! I am over the moon, elated about my purchase. Worth every penny.",Positive,
238,"This phone worked fine for about 3 months and then just as the warranty ended this phone started to have a lot of problems. I was only able to use the phone on speaker phone for a while so people could hear me. I have had a lot of issues with the speaker and this week the screen started to flash with lines across the phone. I contacted the seller this was a faulty product. It has 0 water damage, hasn't been dropped and has an otter box case. They said it is out of the warranty time period and can do nothing for me.",Negative,
239,"Worked as advertised. As a refurbished iPhone, you are always worried that it may not work as well as a new iPhone. I have been pleasantly surprised with the overall condition and performance of the device. The savings and the warranty were attractive enough for me to take the risk. Based on my experience so far, I would do it again.",Positive,
240,"Great phone, could not tell it was refurbished, came with a screen protector on it. The only bummer is that it did not come with ear pods but I noticed Apple is no longer giving those out either, so it's all good! It turned out to $40 cheaper than a new phone, and with some Amazon credits I had I would up getting a $600 phone for about $420, go refurb!",Positive,
241,Phone as described I definitely recommend this product no noticeable dents or scratches on the screen. Does show wear but only when closely inspected not just from looking at the phone. So far it�s good this is my first day using the device so if anything changes I�ll update my review.,Positive,
242,Screen is covered in tiny scratches. Looks like it was kept in someone�s pocket constantly with keys. I can tell the phone was taken apart at some point because there are pry marks on the side of it. For $530 I should have just spent the extra $130 to buy a brand new one.,Negative,
243,"I was hesitant to get a ""renewed"" phone, but it has worked just as well as advertised. I'm very happy with it and would renewed again.",Positive,
244,"Right off the bat I knew something wasn�t right, the speakers weren�t loud, camera wasn�t up to par and the screen had a light spot in it all compared to my girlfriends iPhone 11. Fast forward 4 months later shortly after the return window closed for the phone it stoped working. The cellular data is locked out making it unable to do anything until I �update it� even though we fixed and update to the latest iOS. We took it to both an AT&T store and an apple store where they then informed us that it�s not even a real iPhone 11. I would not recommend buying this and don�t see how this is not illegal in some form of way.",Negative,
245,"Great value, screen sometimes doesn�t want to operate like it freezes up sometimes and I have to close out of the app I was in or sometimes it�s slow a little but I can live with it. Everything is in perfect working order and screen is in great condition came with a screen protector. Awesome phone, wish the battery life was a little longer though, last maybe two-three hours using it. Checking my phone and going on every now and then last about ten hours, so not too bad.",Positive,
246,"The best phone for the BEST price, BuySpry really did it again. Second time buying from them and honestly they did not disappoint. Battery life is at 100% health, screen, body of the phone are completely unharmed as if I had just bought it straight from apple. Also, it even came with tempered glass already on the screen which is an added plus!! I'm so so happy I purchased my phone here.",Positive,
247,I wasn�t sure that I wanted to change phones but this iphone11 is a dream. I didn�t realize how good it would be and I am now an iPhone lover. The seller was super.,Positive,
248,"La verdad que al ser un telefono renovado pude recuperar toda la informacion de otro iphone lo que es genial aun no puedo hablar de la bateria lo estoy cargando, venia cin algunos raspones pero con una proteccion no se notaran, por el momento estoy feliz, dire algo mas cuando lo prube mas dias funciona muy bien en chile",Positive,
249,I love my new iphone! The video quality is so good and there are so many accessories that i can get to go with it. People can't believe i shoot all my IG content on this phone or how fast I produce the content. Between the audio accessories I bought and music features on garageband I shoot and edit right in Imovie which has green screen features now and export so quickly. I even shot a music video in my GARAGE that no one believed was actually my garage because Imovie did such a dope job with it's green screen. Highly recommend especially for this refurbished price.,Positive,
250,"It is not an Iphone
It is made in china also it is scratched",Negative,
251,"Phone came with screen seriously scratched. It says that they have minor blemishes that are ""not visible when held at arms length."" But that is BS as this phone had pretty serious scratches on the screen. Other blemishes would be fine, but not on the screen. Will be sending back for a replacement, since they already have my money and I know it will be a pain to get a refund.",Negative,
252,"This phone appears to work well, but I was quite disappointed by the appearance. The screen and phone case are very scratched up. If I didn't need a phone immediately I would have sent it back. REally expected a nicer looking phone.",Neutral,
253,So my phone has been working great since I bought it in May 2020. I take great care of it. I have a case on it. It hasn�t gotten wet or anything. I did the new update recently and it was fine at first but the cellular isn�t working. Apple said it was a hardware issue.,Negative,
254,"Bought this unlocked iPhone with skepticism after reading the reviews. The phone looks like brand new, no scratches. Bought a SIM card from my phone carrier and so far has met my expectations. I only charge it once a day which is great, compared to the other iPhones I had. Purple color is beautiful, looks more like lavender. Amazon customer tech support was very helpful and even connected me with Apple support to obtain help with the data transfer from my old phone. A great buy at a reasonable price!",Positive,
255,I was skeptical getting the phone but for the price it works perfectly it does everything an apple product is supposed to. Now it didn�t come in the original packaging which I didn�t mind. And the charging cable is long which I find a bonus. Overall I love it,Positive,
256," It�s a good phone but the reason why I give it 4 stars is because I had to unlocked the FaceTime and imessages ( from turning green ) on. If have any of those difficulties please contact apple right away and they�ll help you. You�ll thank me in the future.100 if you notice , the purple phone always tends to work better than the other colors phone by looking at these reviews.",Positive,
257,"Fast shipping works just like new no scratches or anything in particular so far so good,I recently bought (2) from different sellers and I had to send it back within days.,fingers cross I would recommend it to anyone who has problems like me in the past with others sellers this renewed are basically new ones",Positive,
258,"When I was looking for a new phone, I didn�t care that it was renewed. I�ve never had problems with renewed phones. So I came here first. I saw so many misleading things about these phones. But I made the purchase anyway. The phone came with 97% battery life, no scratches, no dents, and it was completely unlocked. Basically brand new. And I LOVE IT. I nervously waited for the package. And when i finally got it and everything was perfectly fine with it. I was amazed. So many people had said, so many misleading things. But truth is? IT AMAZING. GO FOR IT!",Positive,
259,"I purchased this phone as a gift for my dad. Right away I had trouble setting it up, When transferring all the data from his old iPhone it froze. A couple of days later the phone randomly shut off and wouldn't turn back on. The phone itself was fine physically.",Negative,
260,"I have yet to be disappointed with this phone!!! Yes... took me a minute to get used to the phone/screen size comparing an iPhone 7 but hands down... Good job Apple and good job Amazon for a clean... refurbished product that works so flush 

The data transfer via Cloud was super fast and easy. Probably the best I�ve dealt with yet.

Screen resolution... keyboard tranquility... overall battery & performance?? Forget about it... because this device has it all !!!!",Positive,
261,"My iPhone 11 stopped working just after the 90 day �replacement/repair� window ended. For $700 I expect my phone to work longer than 90 days, if you feel the same I SUGGEST YOU SHOP ELSEWHERE! PS- I did contact the seller and ask for help to which they offered NONE.",Negative,
262,"Purchased this phone for relative who was leaving the country and needed an unlocked phone while traveling overseas. It was shipped fast, arrived on time but was very disappointing to see very clear signs of wear and tear. The phone had scratches everywhere, which you would expect since it wasn�t new but a huge scratch on the top right side of the screen was shocking. The phone actually looked like it had been abused. I wanted to return it but couldn�t because the person whom it was for had to leave the country the next day.",Negative,
263,phone was great com card would fit in com card tray had to return so far have not received A refund Will not re-order until I receive a refund the phone itself looked great but was of no value if you cannot use it as a telephone patiently waiting for a refund,Neutral,
264,"I ordered an iphone 11 and the day I activated it, I could barely hear notifications, rings, people on the phone, and it kept freezing on screens. I was trying to contact Buyspry, Marketplace, and any combination of those to get help for a return/refund of over $600, followed all instruction on the booklet provided, and there were always pieces of information missing in order to complete the return. I'm still waiting for the return label they said was provided in a recent message but have no idea where it's provided as they stated. They won't reply to the phone number given and are stalling until the return date is too late. Stay away from buyspry!",Negative,
265,"I can not coment on the actual performance, except to say that If you are an Apple user this is a good choice. My friend did not like the xr. This one has huge storage capacity, retina display, and there are plenty of accessory items available.",Positive,
266,"As always, I was a bit skeptical about ordering a $800 phone off amazon but I�m so glad I did. It even came with a screen protector and it came brand new, only a tiny scratch on the screen protector but other then that the phone was spotless. So happy with what I got and happy it saved me a couple $100. The phone also came unlocked and had no trouble switching it over to my network. 10/10!",Positive,
267,I was realllllyyyy scared to purchase a phone off of Amazon at first. I had it in my cart for days but I�m glad I decided to go ahead and purchase this. I�ve been having the phone for over 6 months and have had 0 problems. I was able to activate it with my phone provider with no issues as well. No regrets at all.,Positive,
268,"Super skeptical after the 1 star reviews, but hey 90 Amazon money back I figure what the heck. Great product basically new batter capacity is 100% no problems with the phone. I got a t mobile specific phone swapped the sim and off I went. Nice product",Positive,
269,"Phone arrived quickly, it looked brand new. It even had a screen protector and AppleCare for the next 6 months which we didn�t know we were getting either. Also, the charger it came with looks to be a fast charger and it does charge the phone super fast. The only con is that the battery life is already at 86, but that is expected considering it�s refurbished. We were a little hesitant considering there wasn�t too many reviews, but so far we are extremely happy with the product. We will buy from seller again in the future.",Positive,
270,I went to the store to get this phone set up twice and both times they said it wasn�t fully unlocked.,Negative,
271,"I ordered this phone because I was due for a new one, and I needed more storage space. I came across this one and I thought it was a great deal but was nervous about it being renewed. I read all the reviews and the only doubts I had was when the battery life wasn�t at 100%, with the phone being renewed, it states very clearly that it wouldn�t come in the original Apple box or the Apple charger and cube. So when the reviews were bad about that, it was clear they didn�t read the complete description. I went ahead and purchased and was very pleased with it! The phone came with 100% battery life, the screen was perfect, and I was overall very pleased! I highly recommend this phone and company!",Positive,
272,"You Might be skeptical of getting a renewed phone, but so far mine has had no noticeable issues or differences from a brand new one. Even physically, it was flawless; no scratches on the screen or dents or anythin. As far as I�m concerned, I basically got a new IPhone for 100 dollars off so I�m pretty happy with it.",Positive,
273,When i reviceved this phone it looked in great shape i turned it on and i put my SIM chip in it and i got to put my apple ID in it and i couldnt use the C or the F key and then a messeage popped up about the screen being messed up because when the previous owner replaced the screen it wasn't replaced the correct way i couldnt answer calls i couldnt turn my phone off i got a refund and am sending this phone back please stay away from this seller when we tried to contact them they didnt answer or reply!!!!!!!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM NOT ONE BIT. I paid 600 dollars for a phone that didnt work they got me thats for sure i hope they dont get anyone else!!! lesson learned thats for sure!,Negative,
274,I won hundred percent absolutely love my phone it came with a good battery no nicks no dings no scratches just a perfect phone camera is great have no issues with my phone delivery was smooth transfer was smooth absolutely would buy another phone from this company,Positive,
275," The phone It's fine, but I expected that it didn't have any scratches at least.
Ok, i understand that is renewed, although it is true that inside the iphone is fine, face id works, camera back and front ok, icloud free, outside the screen and the back are fine, however the corners have small scratches, sometimes one expects it to arrive well cared.
The battery also has 94% which is fine.
The product arrived early too which is great.
4 of 5 stars just for the scratches.",Positive,
276,"Do not buy.
There is a three month warranty which ended three days ago and now the phone stopped working.
It didn't last!
It's a dud!",Negative,
277,I dislike. I didn�t have an issue until it got stuck in a boot loop and apple tech couldn�t even fix it! 700$ wasted. Returning and getting a refund. Plus didn�t even come with a charger,Negative,
278,"Couldn't even make a phone call! When trying to return it I kept getting stalled. I finally decided to pay the return shipping. Customer service was crap, phone was crap and I will never purchase from this company again!",Negative,
279,"I rarely buy brand new Apple. I have always bought refurbished iPhones and they�ve all been great. This one from Amazon is no exception. It came in a generic box with a generic charger but the phone itself is great. Everything works well, looks beautiful. No scratches on the screen but a few on the back (as stated in the quality assurance). Cameras are great and so is every other feature. If you�re looking to buy a great refurbed iPhone for a good cost, this company does great!",Positive,
280,It was in very good condition but it is garbage it is garbage it will not sync with any of my Apple products I tried to buy AppleCare and I put in the number the serial number the The serial number and he wouldn�t even register at Apple so that makes me Bootleg phones they�re not real Apple phones if they won�t register at Apple then what are they bootleg I have reached out to them and they refused to reach back so I guess this get their intention Don�t buy,Negative,
281,"I sent it back, this was not the renewed quality I had expected.I�ve purchased a renewed product before and this in comparison was sloppy and looked liked I bought off of craigslist. It didn�t look trust worthy so I sent it back.",Negative,
282,"In good condition. No scratches, came with a screen protector.

The only problem is that it has turned off a couple of times when I least expect it after having it less than a month, it turns right back on, but it is a major inconvenience. I had to find a repair shop near me to fix it. Since I use my phone for work, I cannot be without one. I contacted the seller and was only refunded $20 (I kept the phone for my work)

I recommend that if you do get a used phone, to double-check everything before getting rid of your old one.",Neutral,
283,"I was apprehensive about purchasing a telephone online as I�m more of a tangible person. With that being said I did, however, order a refurbished phone from Amazon. This turned out to be one of the best purchases I�ve ever made. The phone arrived with not a scratch on it; looks brand new. After putting in my original Sim card from my 2013 phone, everything just started rolling and no problems were encountered. Highly recommend purchasing this phone!",Positive,
284,"I really liked the packaging that the phone came in. Everything was wrapped, and sealed neatly. I would honestly get as much gigabytes as possible so your phone has enough space, and storage. I wasn�t sure if I should buy this phone because it is amazon renewed, but they did a great job. Battery life was perfect, screen and all is functional. Make sure you have a SIM card for the phone. The value is kind of expensive but it�s worth it, also the phone is fully unlocked and that is very important!. Thank you!",Positive,

287,Mine just came in today and man am I disappointed im not even going to turn it on 4-6 massive scratches on the phone visible from more than arms length away also looks like someone intentionally scratched it how did this make it past review,Negative,
288,I�ve had this phone for 3months and it has started to glitch and freeze. Buy the warranty package. I purchased another phone with the warranty protection package and I forgot to add the warranty to this phone as well. :(((( the phone works well enough just a minor annoyance.,Neutral,
289,Wife loves this phone and me too. The only phone I like better is s20ultra. She got red and the finish is beautiful. Call quality stood out from previous phones as it is exceptionally loud n clear. Sounds like the people you're talking to are right in front of you,Positive,
290,"When I unboxed the iPhone the touch screen didn�t work. I drained the battery and charged it up and that got the touch screen working.
When I tried to use my newly purchased SIM card from Straight Talk it did not work!
The iPhone Is locked and will not except the SIM card!",Negative,
291,"IPhone is in excellent physical/visual condition. However, if I pay the price that is sooo close to the Apple cost then why do I have all these problems?!! Even if the purchase is a ""risk"" (because it's renewed/refurbished) Why take so long to respond to help resolve issues?!!! This is frustrating!!! I've contacted my carrier and the phone is indeed unlocked but something on the inside is not working properly. But can't get this resolved in a reasonable amount of time because this company doesn't respond in a reasonable amount of time!!!!!!!!!",Negative,
292,"Even though this was a refurbished phone it still looked like new. Works great and came with a 100% battery which was a biggie for us. Came with aftermarket accessories, but that's what the listing said it would have. We are happy with our purchase.",Positive,

295,"La verdad tenia miedo de comprarlo x amazon ya que no vivo en USA, pero la verdad vale la pena! buen�simo, lo he exprimido al m�ximo ( lo he usado continuamente en google meet, clases, etc.) y otras actividades que requieren bastante energ�a de un celular en todos los sentidos, y tanto en la bater�a c�mo en las funciones funciona a la perfecci�n!

I would recommend others to purchase as well.",Positive,

303,So far so good! I needed to upgrade my phone for awhile and postponed. This was such a. Great deal on a refurbished phone. A 36 month contract with a phone carrier to get a similar phone would have cost me double.,Positive,
304,"Love the phone, brand new conditions, I didn�t see any problems. Great battery life. Like I can be on 1% and still use my phone no problems. Came quickly. I bought the unlocked version and I have T-Mobile. I�ve had the phone for about a month no issues. T-Mobile was able to easily connect it with my old number. My only issue is that my google accounts keep asking me for my password. Not sure if that�s a phone issue or a gmail issue.",Positive,
305,Phone did not work and started glitching immediately then froze. Was a bday present for my daughter. Thankfully Amazon let us return for full refund. Buyer beware!,Negative,
306,I�m IN LOVE with this phone and the fact that it�s like brand new and unlocked just made it better for me. Seriously it was like buying a brand spanking new iPhone for a much lower price. The camera quality is why I wanted this phone to begin with but everything else just makes the phone so great. I�m very happy!,Positive,
307,"The top right side of the screen is extremely scratched. It is apparent that even though the screen is very scratched, the screen has been replaced. The phone is giving an error message saying that it can not support the display screen. Phone is extremely slow and won't let me sign into my icloud account. Very disappointed in the purchase.",Negative,

310,Pice of junk I want my money back for this pice of junk iPhone,Negative,
311,"I bought this and used it for about two years and recently gifted it to my daughter. It doesn�t act used, even after I used it. Battery life stays long as long as you don�t use with while charging but that�s any phone.",Positive,
312,"Perfect product! I was a little worried when first buying this product due to it being refurbished but it works great just like brand new! Not one scratch or mark and if your has one on it, it possibly could have came from the delivery truck or processor rather than the manufacturer.

I�m so angry cuz it was used and payed full price and it doesn�t even work correctly.,Negative,

317,"First of all, it is false advertisement! I received my phone today and the phone is not unlocked! The seller needs to stop playing w/ people's money and lying because we don't have it like that to be going back and forth with this. I advise you to just get a new one.",Negative,
318,First off the Amazon driver dropped my package from his chest on my front door and left my ring door bell caught it all. My charger plug and cord damged and dirty. My glass screen protector cracked. My phone charged all night and died 5 minutes later. Waste of money.,Negative,
319,Daughter love it,Positive,
320,"My biggest disappointment was the battery life. It came at 86% and by the time I downloaded the IOS 15 update it went down to 81%  Was hard for the phone to keep charge after that. Cosmeticaly the phone didnt't have scratches or dents but it could have been cleaner, such as the ear piece and speakers. I tired to clean it but wasn't so successful. Thought the seller I choose would have been a better purchase for me as they had so much 5 stars...guess not",Neutral,
321,"My boyfriend just bought me this phone as a late anniversary gift since he knew I had been wanting one, it came unlocked as it was stated. I wish it didn�t have little bits of scratches in the corners shown in the pictures but once I put a case on it won�t matter. I also would of liked the battery life to be 100% but again, I�m just glad it looks as good as it does and I appreciate that it even already had a screen protector on it. And it came super fast! Thanks so much (:",Positive,
322,Amazing find for a present! The person loved their gift and got it for a great price. Easy to transfer info onto new phone and everything runs smoothly! Thanks,Positive,
323,"Oh well.
The phone works great. no problems. would have preferred to get brand new.... Pd $700... if I'd only known then What I know now... July 9 - Sept. 9..... 2 months and I could've gotten brand new from my cellular provider for $590",Positive,
324,I have not had any problems whatsoever. There was not a single mark in this phone it looked brand new. So far it�s working fine,Positive,
325,"I was kind of skeptical at first to buy it, I know amazon it�s quality, but read some experiences that went wrong and I was scared it was going to be the same for me, but I took the chance and I have 0 regrets. I got the phone in nearly mint condition, I cannot see any scratches, the battery is at 100% and the face ID works just fine. Have been with my new phone for 2 weeks and everything works perfect. I love it and I loved the price and it came with a screen protector installed and all. 100% worth my money, helping the planet and saving some money.",Positive,
326,"This phone is not fully unlocked as advertised, and it�s nothing but garbage. You only could use it with GSM carriers, and you won�t have no access to voicemail. I received the phone in crappy condition, and it was broken in pieces. Seller won�t exchange it for me at all.",Negative,
327,"The product arrived a day early. Nice. The phone was in excellent condition, no scratches on phone nor screen. Fully charged, I went to ATT and got a SIM card, took minutes and free. Since I lost my phone and did not backup, my fault, I had to download apps and do my own email stuff. The phone is nice with works well. Very happy, only had it one day, but we are off to a great start!",Positive,
328,I have to be up front and say I wasn�t sure about this at first. It was a lot of money to pay. Considering it�s my first iPhone coming from android. I got the iPhone 11 fully unlocked in black and it was super easy to get activated. A fast charger came with it no headphones but I use truly wireless earbuds so I�m good. My final verdict is buy the phone it will be a great investment. My experience has been so great my woman wanted one so we�re currently waiting for it to come in the mail.,Positive,
329,It was exactly as described. Should have paid attention to the memory amount but that was my own fault. Love the red. And the camera is outstanding,Positive,
330,The only the thing I didn�t like is the charger it came with I�m going to be honest that charger I could have gone without it it takes so long to charge the phone but otherwise everything was smooth,Positive,
331,"The phone works great, it came fast, and works like it's brand new. There was a few scratches but that's expected with a refurbished device. The battery life was at 88%",Positive,
332,after I started using in 2 weeks later the phone stop responding to touch and phone goes black while on the phone and will not respond .apple support will not fix the problem they told me the phone is out of warranty,Negative,
333,"When I updated my phone yesterday, I got the above message. Don't know how to fix it, don't have any idea what it means other that my phone may not be an Apple phone. What to do now?",Negative,
334,I was so worried about buying a phone from here (iPhone 11) . It�s for my sons birthday and I haven�t given it to him yet so I�m not sure how it�s operating but it looks nearly brand new and it�s charging to 100%. I�ll update if there�s any problems but I have a feeling all will be fine.,Positive,
335,"I usually buy all my phones from this seller.
But this one came with a defective microphone.
However appearance and functionality was good as new.",Neutral,
336,"I purchased this phone as a xmas gift for my granddaughter. Looked great, worked etc. This week without being dropped, wet, or anything suddenly the battery literally swelled which caused the face of the phone to fall off. Per phone store will cost over $200 to replace. Not happy with this. Attempting to contact seller.",Negative,
337,It�s nice and I definitely understand it was used but you literally could have said the microphone is some how clogged up and people barely hear me and it didn�t even come with headphones I might return it I don�t know but hey I phone 11 woo hoo..,Negative,
338,The device came in an original box and was in great (like-new) condition. No scrathches at all. The charger is off-brand and charges a bit slow. Get yourself an OEM charger or something more powerful if you don't have one already.,Positive,
339,The regular iPhone 11 is small for me. Therefore I returned it. I am a former Android owner so using a iPhone is way different. Went back to ads and Android.,Neutral,

One tiny scuff on the top edge but only noticeable because I was looking for them. No cracks. Honestly was sooo nervous about ordering it but after a couple days, I just did it. I�m so relieved it was worth it! I�m writing this review from it! I�m sorry for the others it didn�t work out for but it gets my 100% approval.",Positive,
343,I had the iphone 7 that started to show signs of failure. I wanted a bigger screen and an upgraded camera but didn't want to pay the $1000 plus dollars for it. I found this phone and pulled the trigger. I'm always worried about possible issues when spending this kind of money. I'm happy to say the phone is working great after 4 months. The camera is fantastic and shots with low light is no longer a problem. I use the phone with strava so it gets good use while I'm cycling. I'll buy another iphone from this seller when the time comes.,Positive,
344,It has some issue with volume and when I put the speaker mode in a call the sound quality is bad . It shows signs that it was opened and screwed back in at the bottom of the phone where the speakers are. I ended up buying headphones to be able to use it. I put volume on maximum to have a disent sound. I understand that it is a renewed model but for the price i paid i was expecting a much better quality . Battery life is very good,Neutral,
345,I've tried the other resellers and been disappointed. Totally happy with my experience and would use them again for sure. Now if I can just get my young adult children to stop destroying their phones!,Positive,
346,Do not waste your money on this phone. It says internationally unlocked but it's crap. It is not reliable. One minute it works the next minute no service. The phone came with the screen chipped around the edge and it has been downstream since. The sellers are terrible.,Negative,
347,I bought this back in October because my old iPhone wasn�t working properly. The phone came in within 2 days of purchase. In perfect condition and never had a single issue. Definitely worth it and cheaper than buying at any store!,Positive,
348,"Phone was advertised as a renewed i-Phone 11, T-Mobile. It is in great condition, but was locked and not compatible with T-Mobile. Very disappointed in the false advertising.",Negative,
349,"Purchased this for my 20yr old daughter. So far she�s pretty pleased. I think I purchased her iPhone 8 from this company, and if so they deserve the 5 star�s that was given.",Positive,
350,The Phone came quickly was able to set it up by myself with little issue ( very proud of that ) . No scratches looked brand-new excellent condition. A little bummed battery was only at 92% but other then that its been great for the past 2 weeks I've had it,Positive,
351,"Really good, had some problems with set up but I think that�s an Apple problem not phone problem. It�s worked great for the last couple weeks! Really love it",Positive,
352,"I bought this phone for my daughter 17 years old, she is happy with it . The phone looks good working fine without any problems.",Positive,
353,I was very hesitant due to �it�s too good to be true� old saying. But honestly it works like new with a minor set back. Siri doesn�t respond to voice so me saying � HEY SIRI� doesn�t do much. Weirdly enough it does activate randomly to loud coughs. Which is strange but this is an on off deal. I really enjoy it. Besides the Siri dearer there�s a chip of paint near the bottom lens that would frustrate someone with OCD. Overall good buy. I lucked out.,Positive,
354,Arrived quickly and packaged perfectly. The receivers couldn't have been more pleased. Great quality. I'm very happy with the purchase.,Positive,
355,Phone works better than expected the facia recognition the fingerprint reader and battery life is better than my iPhone XOR,Positive,
356,"Pro�s about the purchase: Phone arrived a day earlier than expected and was in excellent condition and even had a screen protector on the screen so that was a plus

Cons about the purchase: The phone had a bad SIM card reader in it and would not read my SIM card even after taking to AT&T for a new Sim so I had to take it to a repair shop and pay an additional $80 for a repair in order for my SIM card to work",Neutral,
357,"I�ve had this phone for a few days, and everything seems to work great! The battery life came at 86% But I can go with the whole day without charging it! At the end of the day the battery is usually at 45-50%. There isn�t even any scratches or marks that I can notice. This package was delivered on time and it even came with a charger and a cube (not apple products but still work just the same). So glad I was able to save some money!!",Positive,
358,"Well I wasn't going to write a review but hopefully it'll help someone in the future...I bought this phone for my son and took it to our carrier who informed me that this phone wasn't unlocked and had 2 MEI numbers we even called Apple who then informed us that the phone would only work overseas. I returned it without a problem and received a full refund, which I'm very thankful for because this phone wasn't cheap and it kept powering on and off by itself which was unusual.",Negative,
359,Love this phone.,Positive,
360,"Had to contact Apple support because it apparently had multiple Apple IDs on the same device before, so set up was a bit lame, but once i got in, it was smooth as hell. Still can�t believe I got it at such good price. And it even came with a screen protector!",Positive,
361,"Overall i would be inclined to give this item a higher rating as the phone itself was in great condition, however upon arrival the phones microphone did not work at all...a message was sent to seller with no response at all, only an approval for a refund...item was returned immediately and waiting on refund...I would have just asked for an exchange (less hassle) however due to sellers silence I will just get a refund and shop somewhere else I guess...",Negative,

364,I�ve had my phone for about a week now. No scratches anywhere on the iPhone and it�s internally sound. I�ve had no problems whatsoever.,Positive,
365,"A good product for value. I found other phones that were $30-$60 cheaper, and this phone did come with some slight cosmetic problems on the body. But overall I chose to go with this product due to 1)it coming with accessories, 2) it had the option of getting a protection warranty, and 3) it being an Amazon trusted item with the ability to return.

Battery life is at 91% capacity which is good.",Positive,
366,Has few glitches. My iPhone screen zooms in by itself all the time. I put a screen protected and case on it from the day I bought it. It fell from my lap on to the floor and stopped working of 12 hours. Then it just magically started working again.,Negative,
367,Even if the phone was �renewed� I didn�t encounter any issues or problems.,Positive,
368,AT&T turned off my service because phone reported stolen. Now wife had to go back to her old phone. I have to go to buy new phone now. Can�t believe Amazon sell stolen property.,Negative,

372,Purchased this as a gift for my younger sibling. Works great but does come in an unorthodox box and the charger did not work well. Still an Apple product and worked fine with any carrier. I would definitely take it to a carrier to be activated.,Positive,
373,"This phone was not having a great battery life as expected or reviewed others, maybe renewed compromise. Display was not that great, had some wear and tear. But features of Iphone 11 are all functional. Had to return but its almost more than 2 weeks, I have not received the refund of it.",Neutral,
374,"phone came with screen protector on it, not in a apple box but came in perfect condition and 100% battery life capacity.

could not be happier with my purchase!",Positive,
375,"The phone came in like brand new. I�ve been using it for over a month now and it works like brand new. It�s definitely worth the money, and exceeded my expectations. There were no visible or harsh scratches or damage to it when it arrived, and compared to my iPhone 6, the battery life is long. There are plenty of reasons to buy a refurbished phone; money saving and reusing is one of them. I�d say go for it if you really want to.",Positive,
376,"excellent product, the phone arrived in good condition battery in 99% without shock without wear. the bands released for my country Guatemala, full unlocked. The shipped charger is not the original one however it is not relevant.",Positive,
377,The zero does not work,Negative,
378,iPhone came as describe and works well. Noticed some little bumps at the bottom of the screen but nothing bad and knew some minor imperfections were bound to come with the phone.

Just wish the phone was packaged better because it was clanging around in the box and could have caused potential damage to the phone during shipment.,Positive,
379,"My camera seems to be messing up, might be sending it back if it keeps acting up. Every time I switch to portrait mode and take a picture my phone freezes up. Other than that everything is perfect!",Neutral,
380,"Very poor quality control before selling product!
Buying renewed doesn�t phase me because you figure all the problems were resolved...
And should have been!!
Arrived on time.
After setting up the speaker severely distorted, Phone worthless if you can�t use it!
No way should this have been sold as it was!
Waste of my valuable time and sad disappointment fir my kiddo.
Plus - with Amazon prime - Total and fast refund!",Negative,
381,The phone came a day late. It was as described and seems to be in working order. It holds a charge good. My son is happy with the new phone ,Positive,
382,"Everything about this phone would�ve been perfect, until I tried using speaker phone� it�s extremely muffled. The phones speaker output is defective, so expect flaws with refurbished phones. I�ve never had a negative experience until this purchase but I still can�t entirely hate it. I guess just do more research.",Neutral,
383,My Face ID didn�t work. My front portrait mode doesn�t work They offered to replace but I would have had to send the whole phone back in order to replace which would�ve left me with no phone until they decided rather on rather not they would fix/replace it .

I did have a problem with the supplied aftermarket charging cable, as the phone would give the �accessory not supported� notification. When I swapped to another charge cable the problem stopped and the battery was able to fully charge. Although mine did not arrive in the original packaging, it was well packed in bubble wrap with a glass screen protector installed. Overall, I am satisfied with the phone, although don�t count on the accessories.",Positive,

391,"I knew it was a shot in the dark ordering. When phone arrived. Looked okay. Had lots of scratches and the back camera was chipped. When trying to set up the phone, would not update to the latest IOS. Would not let you skip around. Gave option to return in exchange for new phone. Hope that one is functioning.",Negative,
392,This was a great value for us. On our iPhone 7 it used the fingerprint the iPhone 11 uses face Recognition I love it!! Also no home button. You just swipe so much easier!! I actually bought two of them one red and one black fir my husband. They both look and act like new phones. Only way to go!!,Positive,
393,"Came like brand new, with no back scratches and a glass screen protector already applied also has 100% Maximum battery capacity. It�s only about 100 dollars cheaper than on apple's online store and does not include the Apple iphone box, earbuds or charger.",Positive,
394,"I recommend to anyone who is going to invest their money in this not to buy it, they are not supposed to sell damaged things, buy one of these and it would turn on and off by itself, so it is useless to sell something damaged",Negative,
395,Phone works perfectly! There was a slight cosmetic scratch on the front of my phone but that�s what you get for buying preowned. Had no issues with the phone though and it arrived earlier than expected. Satisfied with my purchase. Upgraded from an iPhone 6 and the battery life is just amazing on the 11.,Positive,

403,"I just messaged the seller, and hoping to hear from them soon.
The phone came super quick, which is amazing. I was able to figure out how to transfer my info super fast and I was happy to be saving money and causing less damage to the planet.

I hope they are able to work with me to either send me another one or fix this one.",Negative,

405,"I wouldnt pay more than $100 for this thing. They've obviously done a terrible job fixing whatever issue this phone had in the refurbishing process. The thing is so slow it crashes when scrolling through simple apps like Twitter or Instagram. Need to back up your photos? Forget it, impossible on this thing. Quite literally unusable for anything but calls. Absolute waste of money. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER.",Negative,
406,The IPhone came in and was one excellent condition! It had a screen protector installed already which was done perfectly! Extremely satisfied with these guys!,Positive,
407,Screen had black spot lower right corner. SIM card port didn�t work verified by apple support. Apple support was the one who urged me to get a refund or exchange. 70 dollars more for a brand new iPhone will save you a lot of headache.,Negative,
408,"Couldn�t find a phone anywhere during the pandemic as my old ones battery was dying out. I was a little Leary on purchasing this kind of product from Amazon but it arrived quickly, no damage and set up and operated very easily.

My phone had two cosmetic wear signals. The corner of the screen was scratched and it has a dent in the corner.",Neutral,
413,"The phone arrived ahead of schedule, but it was immediately and clearly obvious that one of the rear camera lenses was cracked in multiple places (which was helpfully covered by a gross dirt-streaked sticker). The seller's ""certified"" / ""renewed"" product label is dubious, at best.

459,We thought it worked cause it turned on and we transferred data. It gets hot and turns off completely during calls or texting and also when I�m not even using it I can see it turn on and off.

460,Everything on the outside of this phone was just okay until I switched it ON and used it for a couple hours.
