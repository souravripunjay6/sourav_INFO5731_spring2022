the willard schmidt collection, documents some of the administrative duties of willard schmidt, the chief of internal security for the war relocation authority and the tule lake incarceration/segregation camp. this collection contains administrative records and photos documenting the tule lake camp, the largest incarceration camp with a peak population of 18,789 and with the most turbulent history. in 1943, the camp was turned into a segregation center to house ""disloyal"" japanese americans relocated from other camps based on their answers to a confusing loyalty questionnaire. the camp endured martial law from november 1943- jan 1944 after escalating protests and unrest. the hostile environment of the camp lead to many incarcerees renouncing their american citizenship upon the end of incarceration, a process which took 14 years to reverse if they did not wish to be deported to japan.see the full finding aid at online archive of california.

this collection consists of selected papers collected by the commission on wartime relocation and internment of civilians (cwric), which was created on july 30, 1980 by an act of congress. formed mainly to investigate matters surrounding the incarceration and to recommend appropriate remedies, the cwric had no power to correct grievances and was viewed as a ""copout"" by those fighting for more immediate redress. still, hearings were conducted in 20 cities across the nation beginning in 1981, and in 1982 the cwric issued its report 'personal justice denied.' it was an exhaustive work that combined the testimonies of former camp inmates given at the hearings and research conducted by a team led by aiko yoshinaga herzig. herzig and legal historian peter irons discovered declassified documents verifying that the government had withheld information showing that there was no military necessity in the forced removal and incarceration of japanese americans. ultimately, the cwric recommended, among other things, $20,000 individual compensation to those incarcerated and a formal government apology. this recommendation would be the basis for the many redress bills that were to follow.
the collection also includes a selection of written testimonies submitted to the commission in 1981 for the seattle, washington, and washington, d.c., hearings. also included are selected written testimonies submitted for hearings on the civil liberties act of 1983, h.r. 4110 and s. 2116.

this collection consists of selected articles from the bainbridge island review, a community paper from bainbridge island, washington. during world war ii, the bainbridge island review was the sole newspaper on the west coast to continuously speak out against the mass removal and incarceration of japanese americans, primarily through the editorials of walt woodward, editor from 1935-1963. woodward also published a weekly article about life in camp written by various bainbridge islanders incarcerated at manzanar and minidoka concentration camps, allowing the japanese americans to continue to have a voice in the bainbridge island community.

the terakawa collection consists of four photograph albums created by hanako terakawa. hanako's parents, tadaichi and yoni yoshioka, immigrated from japan and settled in hayward, california in the early 1900's. in hayward, they started a family and had five children. they owned a nursery and maintained several greenhouses built around 1913. the earliest photograph album primarily contains photographs of hanako's high school friends, her brother giichi, and picnics and others social events related to their oakland buddhist church community. the yoshioka siblings participated in the young men's and women's buddhist association and their local lumbini club. 

hanako yoshioka married reverend tansai terakawa in 1933 and moved with him to stockton, california. tansai terakawa served as the reverend for the stockton buddhist church until he moved to kyoto, japan for two years with his wife and daughter hiroko. in japan, tansai and hanako spent time with extended family and worked as leaders in the pan-pacific buddhist community. two of the photograph albums focus on the terakawa family's life in kyoto, including visiting family and friends, hosting church delegates from other countries, and participating in the 1934 pan pacific conference in tokyo before returning to california.

during wwii, hanako and tansai, along with their three children were incarcerated in the minidoka concentration camp in idaho, and the yoshioka family, were incarcerated in the topaz concentration camp in utah. tansai and hanako terakawa helped establish a church community in minidoka, where tansai terakawa served as reverend until he passed away in the camp. hanako's brothers, giichi, george, and masaru, all served in the united states army during wwii. hanako terakawa's sister, yukie, was incarcerated in the poston camp with her husband, harry goto, and two children. after the war, the combined yoshioka and terakawa families relocated to minneapolis, minnesota. the final photograph album primarily contains photographs of the yoshioka family, the terakawa family, and the goto family. the album also includes several photographs of the topaz concentration camp, tansai terakawa's memorial service in camp, military portraits of the yoshioka siblings, and their new home in minneapolis after the war.

at the age of thirteen, takeharu inouye and his immediate family experienced forced relocation to the sacramento assembly center (walerga), and were subsequently moved to the tule lake concentration camp. they remained at tule lake for the duration of wwii due to their ""disloyal"" sentiments. takeharu recorded his experiences at tule lake in three diaries, which describe his struggles with the american and japanese schools, the difficult farm work, the emotional fallout from the tule lake labor strikes, and the limited recreational options available to young japanese americans in the camp. he provides details on the movies he watched, the effects of the weather each day, and the tension caused by escalating military presence. 

this bulk of this collection is composed of takeharu inouye's three diaries, dated from 1942-1944. also included are four items pertaining to takeharu inouye's employment during and after wwii: one w.r.a. nametag, one civil service commission notice of rating, and two war department notifications of personnel action. an envelope containing various programs and itineraries for the 1994 tule lake pilgrimage accompanies photographs of takeharu's trips to oregon and california with his wife, setsuko. a clipping of takeharu inouye's obituary in an idaho newspaper provides a conclusion for this collection.

the documents printed here in these nine volumes trace and explicate not only the decision to submit a whole people to internal exile but also delineate the execution and modification of the policy during the course of the war. the documents were drawn largely from the archives of the government department chiefly responsible, the war department, and from the archives of the united states army. the documents were selected from literally tens of thousands of sheets of paper which document the government's role. the basic arrangement of the documents is chronological, although a number of separate matters were treated topically.

wakaichi ""buck"" ohashi family collection is a photo album of the ohashi family.  the album primarily contains photographs of the ohashi family and the japanese american community in ketchikan, alaska prior to wwii.

jasomatsu ""george"" ohashi (1872-1934) immigrated to ketchikan, alaska around 1900 with his wife shika, leaving his young son wakaichi “buck” in japan. he came to alaska following the yukon gold rush, however, he opened a restaurant on front street in ketchikan called ""new york cafe.""  in 1907 george built a storefront and boarding house on stedman street that housed his businesses as well as his growing family.  in the storefront he opened and ran ohashi's grocery. in the following years he and shika had two daughters, mary haruko (1909) and ruth tomo (1917). around 1911, george sent for his son, wakaichi “buck” ohashi to join him in alaska.  during prohibition, george put a pool house and bar in the back of the grocery store. around 1924, buck returned to japan to marry komatsu saito, and in 1924 they returned to ketchikan. together komatsu and buck had 5 children, robert teruo (1926), hope nobuko (1927), neil jiro (1930), edward saburo (1931) and paul masuo (1934). upon george’s death in 1934 buck took over the family business, and in 1936 he closed the grocery and opened ""welexum bar"" in the space.  after a few years the bar was closed and the store front divided into two spaces, a liquor store and a confectionary/ice cream shop.  following the bombing of pearl harbor, on december 7, 1941 buck along with all the issei men in ketchikan, was arrested and detained on annette island. eventually transferred to lordsburg or santa fe in the following months. in 1942, the rest of the ohashi family was removed and detained, initially at camp harmony in puyallup, washington, then at minidoka in idaho.  upon the family’s return to ketchikan in 1945, they reopened the liquor store and confectionary and ran the business until the mid-1990s.

in 1942, president franklin d. roosevelt ordered the evacuation and incarceration of japanese americans with executive order 9066. forty-six years later, congress sought to belatedly address this injustice with the civil liberties act of 1988, which established a process of redress for those harmed by 9066. housed within the department of justice’s civil rights division, the office of redress administration (ora) was the government body created to carry out this historic task. this project documents the history of the ora through ten oral histories with former staff. these never-before-recorded stories chart the development and operation of ora, highlighting the struggles and successes of the agency during its ten-year tenure. the project also includes oral histories with two community leaders that helped facilitate the redress process between the japanese american community and ora. taken together, the project offers scholars and the public one of the first, in-depth looks at japanese american redress.

these interviews were conducted by emi kuboyama, director of professional networks, stanford university.  she served as an attorney for the department of justice’s office of redress administration from 1995-1998.

the santa anita pacemaker was a newspaper published for approximately 19,000 japanese americans who were relocated to the santa anita racetrack turned assembly center for the temporary internment of japanese americans. the newspaper ran for six months in 1942 and was the longest running newspaper out of all the japanese american assembly centers. it was published twice a week first on tuesdays and fridays and then on wednesdays and saturdays. the pacemaker read like a typical small town newspaper, covering every day activities and events that occurred throughout the assembly center. the newspaper was led by editor eddie shimano and only ever had nine staff members and writers. in the first issue of the newspaper, the editorial staff asked its readers to submit names for what it should be called, and ""the pacemaker"" was selected. ""pacemaker"" is a term used in horse racing and refers to the horse that leads the way, therefore setting the pace for the other horses up until a certain point. like all assembly centers, and internment camp newspapers, the newspaper operated under strict regulations and censorship. the staff and writers were prohibited from using the japanese language and each newspaper edition had to go through multiple approvals by camp administrators before being published. the collection starts from the very first pacemaker (april 21, 1942) up through newspaper number fifty (october 7, 1942) and a final book-like pacemaker with no specific date.

newspaper of the rohwer incarceration camp located in mcgehee, arkansas which had a peak population of 8,475 in november of 1943. the rohwer outpost ran from october 24, 1942 to july 21, 1945 and was published twice a week on wednesdays and saturdays. it was then renamed the rohwer relocator released by the wra to provide inmates with the camp's closing procedures and relocation opportunities. the outpost was similar to that of a small town newspaper in that it covered every day events and activities that went on in camp as well as original editorial pieces. the newspaper had both an english section and a japanese section, ""jiho"", starting on opposite ends of the newspaper. the japanese ""jiho"" section started on december 24, 1942 and was largely a direct translation of the english version. like some of the other incarceration camps, but unlike the assembly centers, the outpost was considered to be uncensored for the most part. it had a total of fifteen staff members including editors bean takeda and barry saiki as well as artist george akimoto who created the editorial cartoon character, ""lil dan'l"", and eventually became the camp's mascot.

the evan johnson collection consists of photographs taken by evan johnson when he came to manzanar in december, 1969 with a group from uc davis asian american studies department. in these images, he captured a moment in history: the birth of a grassroots movement that led to the creation of the manzanar committee, which in turn led the fight to preserve manzanar. the legacy continues. each year, on the last saturday in april, hundreds of people of all ages from diverse backgrounds gather at the manzanar cemetery for a day of remembrance with speeches, a memorial service, and traditional ondo dance at the manzanar committee’s annual pilgrimage.
